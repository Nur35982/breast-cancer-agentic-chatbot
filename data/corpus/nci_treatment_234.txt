Although no statistically significant difference was found in the total study population, the lymph node-positive patients who received letrozole also experienced a statistically significant improvement in OS (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38â€“0.98;P= .04), although thePvalue was not corrected for multiple comparisons.
TheNSABP B-33trial (NCT00016432) that was designed to compare 5 years of exemestane with placebo after 5 years of tamoxifen was stopped prematurely when the results ofCAN-NCIC-MA17became available.
At the time of analysis, 560 of the 783 patients who were randomly assigned to receive exemestane remained on that drug and 344 of the 779 patients who were randomly assigned to receive placebo had crossed over to exemestane.[80][Level of evidence B1]An intent-to-treat analysis of the primary study end point, DFS, demonstrated a nonsignificant benefit of exemestane (HR, 0.68;P= .07).
