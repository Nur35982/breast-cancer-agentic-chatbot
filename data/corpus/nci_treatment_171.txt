When possible, suspicious axillary nodes should be biopsied before initiation of systemic treatment.
In patients with clinically negative nodes who receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy, a sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy is typically performed at the time of surgery.
In patients presenting with positive lymph nodes, detected by either clinical examination or imaging, SLN biopsy may be performed in a patient who becomes clinically node negative after preoperative therapy.[7] The use of dual mapping with both radiocolloid and blue dye and retrieval of at least three negative lymph nodes was associated with a lower false-negative rate and ALND may be omitted in these patients.[8][Level of evidence B4]; [9][Level of evidence C2]; [10][Level of evidence C3] When considering preoperative therapy, treatment options include: For HER2-negative breast tumors, an anthracycline/taxane-based chemotherapy regimen.
