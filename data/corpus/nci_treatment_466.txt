The secondary end points were PFS in the total population, OS in the total population, and OS in the hormone receptor–positive group.[54][Level of evidence A1]In the hormone receptor–positive cohort, the median PFS was 10.1 months for patients who received trastuzumab deruxtecan and 5.4 months for patients who received the physician’s choice of chemotherapy (HRdisease progression or death, 0.51;P< .001).
The OS was 23.9 months for patients who received trastuzumab deruxtecan and 17.5 months for patients who received the physician's choice of chemotherapy (HRdeath, 0.64;P= .003).Among all patients, the median PFS was 9.9 months in the trastuzumab deruxtecan group and 5.1 months in the physician’s choice group (HRdisease progression or death, 0.50;P< .001).
