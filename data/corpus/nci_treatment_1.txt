women, with an estimated 59,080 cases of female breast ductal carcinomain situ(DCIS) and 316,950 cases of invasive disease in 2025.[1] About 42,170 women diagnosed with breast cancer—fewer than one in eight—will die of the disease.

For more information, see theSpecial Populationssection in Breast Cancer Screening.
Widespread adoption of screening increases breast cancer incidence in a given population and changes the characteristics of cancers detected, with increased incidence of lower-risk cancers, premalignant lesions, and DCIS.
