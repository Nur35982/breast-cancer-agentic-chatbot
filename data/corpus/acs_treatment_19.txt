Knowing all of your options and finding the resources you need will help you make informed decisions about your care.Whether you are thinking about treatment, getting treatment, or not being treated at all, you can still get supportive care to help with pain or other symptoms.
Communicating with your cancer care team is important so you understand your diagnosis, what treatment is recommended, and ways to maintain or improve your quality of life.Different types of programs and support services may be helpful, and they can be an important part of your care.
These might include nursing or social work services, financial aid, nutritional advice, rehab, or spiritual help.The American Cancer Society also has programs and services - including rides to treatment, lodging, and more - to help you get through treatment.
