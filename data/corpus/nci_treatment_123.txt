The APBI arm had improved cosmetic outcomes as evaluated by both physicians and patients (P= .0001 for both comparisons).
The 10-year cumulative incidence of IBTR was 2.5% in the whole-breast radiation therapy arm and 3.7% in the APBI arm (HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 0.55–4.37;P= .40).
The 10-year OS rate was 91.9% in both arms (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.50–1.79;P= .86).
Breast cancer–specific survival at 10 years was 96.7% in the whole-breast radiation therapy arm and 97.8% in the APBI arm (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.21–1.99;P= .45).
There were fewer acute and late toxicities in the APBI arm (P= .0001 for both comparisons).
