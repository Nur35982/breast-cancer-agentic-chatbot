Because of the early unblinding of the study, longer-term comparative data on the risks and benefits of letrozole in this setting will not be available.[77,78]An updated analysis including all events before unblinding confirmed the results of the interim analysis.[79] In addition, a statistically significant improvement in distant DFS was found for patients who received letrozole (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43–0.84;P= .002).
Although no statistically significant difference was found in the total study population, the lymph node-positive patients who received letrozole also experienced a statistically significant improvement in OS (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.38–0.98;P= .04), although thePvalue was not corrected for multiple comparisons.
