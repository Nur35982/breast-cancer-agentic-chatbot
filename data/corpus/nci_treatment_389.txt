J Clin Oncol 24 (31): 5091-7, 2006.[PUBMED Abstract] Current Clinical Trials Recurrent breast cancer often responds to therapy, although treatment is rarely curative at this stage of disease.
Patients with locoregional breast cancer recurrence may become long-term survivors with appropriate therapy.
The rates of locoregional recurrence have declined over time, and a meta-analysis suggests a recurrence rate of less than 3% in patients treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy.[1] The rates are somewhat higher (up to 10%) for those treated with mastectomy.[2] Nine percent to 25% of patients with locoregional recurrence will have distant metastases or locally extensive disease at the time of recurrence.[3-5] Before treatment for recurrent breast cancer, restaging to evaluate the extent of disease is indicated.
