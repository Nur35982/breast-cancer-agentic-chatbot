Patients were randomly assigned to receive zoledronate 4 mg intravenously (IV) for either 2 years (every 3 months) or 5 years (every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years).
Only those patients who completed 2 years of zoledronate treatment (1,447 on the 2-year arm; 1,729 on the 5-year arm) were included in the final analysis.
The main study end points were DFS and OS.[98]Outcomes were similar between the two arms for DFS (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.76–1.25;P= .83) and OS (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.65–1.34;P= .71).[98][Level of evidence A1]An accompanying editorial explained why the results of this study do not definitively establish how long bisphosphonates should be administered.[99] Outcomes were similar between the two arms for DFS (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.76–1.25;P= .83) and OS (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.65–1.34;P= .71).[98][Level of evidence A1] An accompanying editorial explained why the results of this study do not definitively establish how long bisphosphonates should be administered.[99] The role of adjuvant poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition has been evaluated in patients with early-onset breast cancer and germlineBRCA1orBRCA2pathogenic variants.BRCA1andBRCA2are tumor suppressor genes that encode proteins involved in DNA repair (via the homologous recombination repair pathway).
