A preplanned interim analysis was performed after 243 patients had disease progression or died, and median duration of follow-up was 15.3 months.
After 18 months, the PFS rate was 63.0% (95% CI, 54.6%–70.3%) in the ribociclib group and 42.2% (95% CI, 34.8%–49.5%) in the placebo group.[12]OS was a secondary end point.
A protocol-specified final analysis of OS was published after 400 deaths and a median follow-up of 6.6 years.
Patients who received ribociclib plus letrozole had a significant OS benefit compared with patients who received placebo plus letrozole.
Median OS was 63.9 months in the ribociclib group and 51.4 months in the placebo group (HRdeath, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63–0.93; two-sidedP= .008).[14][Level of evidence A1]Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia occurred in 63.8% of patients in the ribociclib group and 1.2% of patients in the placebo group.
