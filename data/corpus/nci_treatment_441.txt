Evidence (alpelisib plus endocrine therapy): SOLAR-1(NCT02437318) was a randomized phase III trial comparing alpelisib plus fulvestrant with placebo plus fulvestrant.
The trial included 572 postmenopausal women with HER2-negative hormone receptor–positive advanced breast cancer who had received previous endocrine therapy.[33][Level of evidence B1]PIK3CAvariants were confirmed in 341 participants.
The primary end point was PFS in the cohort of patients withPIK3CAvariants.In this cohort, median PFS was 11 months in the alpelisib-plus-fulvestrant arm compared with 5.7 months in the placebo-plus-fulvestrant arm (HRprogressionor HRdeath, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.50−0.85;P< .001).PFS did not differ between arms in the cohort of participants withoutPIK3CAvariants (median PFS, 7.4 months in the alpelisib-plus-fulvestrant arm vs.
