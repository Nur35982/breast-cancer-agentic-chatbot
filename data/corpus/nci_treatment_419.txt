Neutropenia was more common in the abemaciclib arm; however, only 21.1% of participants experienced grade 3 to 4 neutropenia.
Evidence (second-line palbociclib and endocrine therapy): PALOMA-3(NCT01942135) was a double-blind, phase III trial of 521 patients with HER2-negative hormone receptor–positive, advanced breast cancer who had relapsed after or progressed on previous endocrine therapy and were randomly assigned to receive either fulvestrant plus placebo or fulvestrant plus palbociclib.
Premenopausal and postmenopausal patients were eligible.
Premenopausal patients received goserelin.[5][Level of evidence A3]The final PFS analysis showed a median PFS of 9.5 months on the palbociclib-fulvestrant arm versus 4.6 months on the placebo-fulvestrant arm (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.36–0.59;P< .0001).[21][Level of evidence A3]Cytopenias, particularly neutropenia, were much more frequent on the palbociclib-containing arm, but febrile neutropenia was very uncommon (1%) in both groups.
