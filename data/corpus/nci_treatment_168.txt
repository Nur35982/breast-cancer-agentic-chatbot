The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) associated with a one-unit increase in RCB ranged from 1.52 in the HER2-negative hormone receptor–positive group to 2.09 in the HER2-positive hormone receptor–negative group (P< .0001 for all subtypes).[5] Neoadjuvant therapy is particularly favored in patients with triple-negative or HER2-positive disease, when pathological response is used as a guide in choosing the optimal adjuvant therapy after surgery.

Omission of postoperative radiation therapy to the regional nodes in patients who initially present as node positive and become node negative after neoadjuvant therapy is currently being evaluated.
