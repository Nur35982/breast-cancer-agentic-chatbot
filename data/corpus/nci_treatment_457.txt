The Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) trial included more patients who presented with metastatic disease; the Fulvestrant and Anastrozole Combination Therapy (FACT[NCT00256698]) study enrolled more patients who had previously received tamoxifen.[48,49] Evidence (combination endocrine therapy with an AI and fulvestrant): TheSWOG-0226trial (NCT00075764), which enrolled 707 patients, demonstrated a statistically significant difference in PFS (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.68–0.94;P= .007) and OS (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.65–1.00;P= .05).[48][Level of evidence A1] In an analysis done after 5 more years of follow-up, the observed benefits of combined therapy were still present, and the level of significance with respect to OS was greater (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.69–0.98;P= .03).[50][Level of evidence A1] In contrast, the FACT trial, which enrolled 514 patients, found no difference in either disease-free survival (DFS) (HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.81–1.20;P= .91) or OS (HR, 1.0; 95% CI, 0.76–1.32;P= 1.00).[49][Level of evidence A1] The optimal sequence of therapies for hormone receptor–positive metastatic breast cancer is not known.
