The monoclonal antibody denosumab inhibits the receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa beta ligand (RANKL).
A meta-analysis of three phase III trials (NCT00321464,NCT00321620, andNCT00330759) comparing zoledronate versus denosumab for management of bone metastases suggests that denosumab is similar to zoledronate in reducing the risk of a first skeletal-related event.[157] For more information about bisphosphonates, seeCancer Pain.
