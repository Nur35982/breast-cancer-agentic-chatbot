Evidence (breast-conserving surgery plus radiation therapy to the breast): Of the 818 women enrolled in the NSABP-B-17 trial, 80% were diagnosed by mammography, and 70% of the patients' lesions were 1 cm or smaller.
Results were reported at the 12-year actuarial follow-up interval.[7]; [9][Level of evidence B1]The overall rate of in-breast tumor recurrence was reduced from 31.7% to 15.7% when radiation therapy was delivered (P< .005).Radiation therapy reduced the occurrence of invasive cancer from 16.8% to 7.7% (P= .001) and recurrent DCIS from 14.6% to 8.0% (P= .001).Nine pathological features were evaluated for their ability to predict for in-breast recurrence, but only comedo necrosis was a significant predictor for recurrence.
