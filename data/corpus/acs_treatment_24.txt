Some people, especially if the cancer is advanced, might not want to be treated at all.
There are many reasons you might decide not to get cancer treatment, but itâ€™s important to talk to your doctors as you make that decision.
Remember that even if you choose not to treat the cancer, you can still get supportive care to help with pain or other symptoms.
People who have advanced cancer and who are expected to live less than 6 months may want to consider hospice care.
Hospice care is designed to provide the best possible quality of life for people who are near the end of life.
You and your family are encouraged to talk with your doctor or a member of your supportive care team about hospice care options, which include hospice care at home, a special hospice center, or other health care locations.
