A BCI H/I-high designation was predictive of endocrine response.
A subset of patients with hormone receptorâ€“positive, node-positive disease had significant benefit from 10 years (versus 5 years) of tamoxifen therapy.
Patients with a BCI H/I-low designation showed no significant benefit from extended endocrine therapy.[87]The BCI H/I ratio was evaluated as a predictive biomarker of extended endocrine therapy benefit in patients from the IDEAL trial.
Tumor specimens from 908 patients randomly assigned to receive 2.5 years versus 5 years of extended letrozole were evaluated using the BCI.
A BCI H/I-high designation significantly predicted benefit from extended aromatase inhibitor therapy, whereas patients with a BCI H/I-low designation did not derive significant benefit.[88] The BCI H/I ratio was evaluated for its ability to predict benefit from extended endocrine therapy in patients who participated in theaTTomtrial (NCT00003678).
