Evidence (duration of tamoxifen therapy): The EBCTCG meta-analysis demonstrated that 5 years of tamoxifen was superior to shorter durations.
The following results were reported:[21]A highly significant advantage of 5 years versus 1 to 2 years of tamoxifen with respect to the risk of recurrence (proportionate reduction, 15.2%;P< .001) and a less significant advantage with respect to mortality (proportionate reduction, 7.9%;P= .01) was observed.
