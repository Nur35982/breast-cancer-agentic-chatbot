Food and Drug Administration was the MammaPrint gene signature.
The 70-gene signature classifies tumors into high- and low-risk prognostic categories.[67-71] The aim of theMINDACTtrial (NCT00433589) (see below) was to determine the clinical usefulness and patient benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy.
Oncotype DX:The Oncotype DX 21 gene assay is the gene profile test with the most extensive clinical validation thus far and applies to HER2-negative hormone receptor–positive breast cancer.
A 21-gene recurrence score is generated based on the level of expression of each of the 21 genes.
This recurrence score informs prognosis and treatment decision-making.In the node-negative population, the designated risk groups are as follows:Recurrence score ≤11: low risk.
