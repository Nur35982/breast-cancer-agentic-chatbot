A clinical trial of 235 patients with stage 0 to III breast cancer who underwent partial mastectomy, with or without resection of selective margins, randomly assigned patients to have additional cavity shave margins resected (shave group) or not (no-shave group).[22] Patients in the shave group had a significantly lower rate of positive margins than those in the no-shave group (19% vs.
34%,P= .01) and a lower rate of second surgery for clearing margins (10% vs.
21%,P= .02).[22][Level of evidence B3] Axillary node status remains the most important predictor of outcome in patients with breast cancer.
