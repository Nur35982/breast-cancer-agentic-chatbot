However, no survival advantage has been demonstrated to date with this approach.[121,122] Pertuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to a distinct epitope on the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor and inhibits dimerization.
Pertuzumab, in combination with trastuzumab with or without chemotherapy, has been evaluated in two preoperative clinical trials to improve on the pCR rates observed with trastuzumab and chemotherapy.
Evidence (pertuzumab): In the open-label, randomized, phase IINeoSPHEREtrial (NCT00545688),[121] 417 women with tumors that were larger than 2 cm or node-positive, and who had HER2-positive breast cancer, were randomly assigned to one of four preoperative regimens:[121][Level of evidence B3]Docetaxel plus trastuzumab.Docetaxel plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab.Pertuzumab plus trastuzumab.Docetaxel plus pertuzumab.The following results were observed:The pCR rates were 29% for docetaxel plus trastuzumab, 46% for docetaxel plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab, 17% for pertuzumab plus trastuzumab, and 24% for docetaxel plus pertuzumab.
