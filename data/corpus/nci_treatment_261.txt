PARP plays a critical role in DNA repair.
Evidence (olaparib): TheOlympiAtrial (NCT02032823) randomly assigned 1,836 patients with HER2-negative breast cancer and germlineBRCA1orBRCA2pathogenic variants to receive either 1 year of adjuvant olaparib (300 mg twice daily) or placebo.
All women completed surgery and adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
Patients were considered at higher risk of recurrence on the basis of tumor size, node involvement, or the presence of residual cancer after neoadjuvant therapy.[100]Eligibility criteria for patients who underwent initial surgery and received adjuvant chemotherapyPatients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) had axillary node-positive (≥pN1, any tumor size) disease OR axillary node-negative disease with an invasive primary tumor larger than 2 cm (pN0, ≥pT2).At least four pathologically confirmed positive lymph nodes were required for ER- and/or PR-positive/HER2-negative patients.Eligibility criteria for patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgeryPatients with TNBC had residual invasive cancer in the breast and/or resected lymph nodes (i.e., no pCR).ER- and/or PR-positive/HER2-negative patients had residual invasive cancer in the breast and/or resected lymph nodes (i.e., no pCR) AND a CPS+EG (Clinical stage/PathologicalStage +ER status/nuclearGrade) score of 3 or higher.[101]The primary study end point was invasive disease-free survival (IDFS).[100][Level of evidence B1]At the time of the first (and only) planned interim analysis, when 284 events (i.e., invasive disease or death) had occurred, the HR for IDFS strongly favored the olaparib arm, and the prespecified stopping boundary for significance was exceeded (3-year IDFS rate, 85.9% vs 77.1%; HR, 0.58; 99.5% CI, 0.41–0.82;P< .001).[100][Level of evidence B1]Distant DFS was also statistically significantly improved for patients who received olaparib (HR, 0.57; 99.5% CI, 0.39–0.83;P< .001).A difference in OS was also observed (HR, 0.68; 99% CI, 0.44–1.05;P= .02), but it did not meet the prespecified level of significance when corrected for multiple testing (P< .01).Grade 3 or higher adverse events that occurred in more than 1% of patients on the olaparib arm included anemia (8.7%), decreased neutrophil count (4.8%), decreased white cell count (3.0%), fatigue (1.8%), and lymphopenia (1.2%).
