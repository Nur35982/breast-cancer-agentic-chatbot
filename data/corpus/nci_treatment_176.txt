The administration of preoperative AC followed by docetaxel was associated with a higher clinical complete response rate compared with the administration of AC alone (63.6% for AC followed by docetaxel and 40.1% for AC alone;P< .001); a higher pCR rate was also observed (26.1% for AC followed by docetaxel and 13.7% for AC alone;P< .001).
Data from NSABP B-27 and the Aberdeen Breast Group Trial support the use of anthracycline/taxane–based regimens in women with initial response or with relative resistance to anthracyclines.[11] Alternative anthracycline/taxane schedules have also been evaluated (concurrent docetaxel, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide) and appear similar in efficacy to the sequential approach described above.[14][Level of evidence B3] The phase IIIGeparSeptotrial (NCT01583426) investigated an alternative taxane (nab-paclitaxel) in patients with untreated primary breast cancer.[15] Patients (n = 1,229) were randomly assigned to receive 12 weeks of nab-paclitaxel or paclitaxel followed by epirubicin and cyclophosphamide for four cycles.The pCR rate was higher in the nab-paclitaxel arm (233 patients, 38%; 95% CI, 35%–42%) when compared with the paclitaxel arm (174 patients, 29%; 95% CI, 25%–33%).[15][Level of evidence B3]However, in theETNAtrial (NCT01822314) that compared neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel with paclitaxel followed by anthracycline-based therapy, no significant difference in pCR was observed, and neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy were more frequent in the nab-paclitaxel arm.[16]Differences in taxane dose and schedule may explain the different findings in the GeparSepto and ETNA trials.
