Antibody therapy targeting the HER2 pathway has been used since the 1990s and has revolutionized the treatment of HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer.
Several HER2-targeted agents (e.g., trastuzumab, pertuzumab, trastuzumab emtansine, lapatinib) have been approved for treatment of this disease.
Approximately 20% to 25% of patients with breast cancer have tumors that overexpress HER2.[64] Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the HER2 receptor.[64] In patients previously treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy whose tumors overexpress HER2, administration of trastuzumab as a single agent resulted in a response rate of 21%.[65][Level of evidence C3] Evidence (trastuzumab): In a phase III trial, patients with metastatic disease were randomly assigned to receive either chemotherapy alone (doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide or paclitaxel) or the same chemotherapy plus trastuzumab.[66][Level of evidence A1]Patients treated with chemotherapy plus trastuzumab had an OS advantage over those who received chemotherapy alone (25.1 months vs.
