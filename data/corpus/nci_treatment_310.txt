Pertuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to a distinct epitope on the extracellular domain of the HER2 receptor and inhibits dimerization.
Its use, in combination with trastuzumab, has been evaluated in a randomized trial in the postoperative setting.
Evidence (pertuzumab): The Breast Intergroup (BIG) trial enrolled 4,805 women with HER2-positive cancer in a blinded comparison study.
Patients received 12 months of trastuzumab plus placebo versus 12 months of trastuzumab plus pertuzumab, which were given in conjunction with standard chemotherapy and hormone therapy.
The primary end point was IDFS.[125]At the time of the final analysis, the 3-year IDFS rate was 94.1% in the trastuzumab-pertuzumab group and 93.2% in the trastuzumab-placebo group (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.66â€“1.00;P= .045).There was no statistically significant difference in OS (a secondary end point) at the first interim analysis.
