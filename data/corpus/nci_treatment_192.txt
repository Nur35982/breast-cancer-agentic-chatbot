After a median follow-up of 60 months, 5-year outcomes were similar in the EC-T and TC arms for DFS (HR, 1.004; 95% CI, 0.776–1.299) and OS (HR, 0.937; 95% CI, 0.654–1.342).[34][Level of evidence B1] The upper 90% confidence limit for DFS did not exceed the noninferiority boundary of 1.467.
There were five treatment-related deaths among patients who received TC and one death among those who received EC-T, but symptomatic adverse events were more frequent in patients who received EC-T.
The optimal time to initiate adjuvant therapy is uncertain.
Studies have reported the following: A retrospective, observational, single-institution study of patients with early-stage breast cancer who were diagnosed between 1997 and 2011 revealed that delays in initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy adversely affected survival outcomes.[35][Level of evidence C1]Initiation of chemotherapy 61 days or more after surgery was associated with adverse outcomes among patients with stage II breast cancer (distant RFS [DRFS]: HR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.02–1.43) and stage III breast cancer (OS: HR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.26–2.46; RFS: HR, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.01–1.76; and DRFS: HR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.02–1.80).Patients with triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and those with HER2-positive tumors treated with trastuzumab who started chemotherapy 61 days or more after surgery had worse survival (TNBC: HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.09–2.18; HER2-positive: HR, 3.09; 95% CI, 1.49–6.39) than did those who initiated treatment in the first 30 days after surgery.Because of the weaknesses and limitations of this study design, the optimal time to initiate adjuvant chemotherapy remains uncertain.
