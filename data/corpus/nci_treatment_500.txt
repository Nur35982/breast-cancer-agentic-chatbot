90.9%), adverse events leading to treatment discontinuations (7.2% vs.
40.9%), and serious adverse events (20.3% vs.
25.8%).
At median follow-up of 14 months, median PFS was 9.2 months with trastuzumab plus docetaxel and 14.2 months with T-DM1 (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.36–0.97).
Preliminary OS results were similar between treatment arms.
T-DM1 had a favorable safety profile compared with trastuzumab plus docetaxel, with fewer grade 3 adverse events (46.4% vs.
90.9%), adverse events leading to treatment discontinuations (7.2% vs.
40.9%), and serious adverse events (20.3% vs.
25.8%).
Evidence of activity of T-DM1 in heavily pretreated patients with metastatic, HER2-overexpressed breast cancer who had received previous trastuzumab and lapatinib was shown in the randomized phase IIITH3RESAstudy (NCT01419197) of T-DM1 versus physician’s choice of treatment.[76][Level of evidence A1] This trial randomly assigned 602 patients in a 2:1 ratio (404 patients assigned to T-DM1 and 198 patients assigned to physician’s choice) and allowed crossover to T-DM1.At a median follow-up of 7.2 months in the T-DM1 group and 6.5 months in the physician’s-choice group, median PFS was 6.2 months in the T-DM1 group and 3.3 months in the physician’s-choice group (HR, 0.528; 95% CI, 0.422–0.661;P< .0001).OS was significantly longer with trastuzumab emtansine versus the treatment of physician’s choice (median OS, 22.7 months vs.
