19.5 months; HRdeath, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.55–1.06;P= .11), although survival data are not yet mature.The primary toxicity observed with talazoparib was myelosuppression, especially anemia.Patient-reported outcome data demonstrated more favorable effects of talazoparib than standard chemotherapy on quality-of-life measures.[88] Median PFS was significantly longer in the talazoparib group than in the standard therapy group (8.6 months vs.
5.6 months; HRdisease progression or death, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.41–0.71;P< .001).
Benefits were observed in all subgroups, although CIs were wide in the subgroup of patients who had received previous platinum therapy.
