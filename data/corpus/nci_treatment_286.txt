The primary outcome was pCR.
There was no significant difference in pCR rate in the breast between the arms (56.5% sequential, 54.2% concurrent; difference, 2.3%; 95% CI, -9.3 to 13.9).
Asymptomatic declines in LVEF during preoperative chemotherapy were identified in similar proportions of patients in each arm.
DFS and OS were secondary outcomes.
After median follow-up of 5.1 years, there was no difference in DFS (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.56−1.83;P= .96) or OS (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.48−2.88;P= .73) between the sequential and concurrent arms.[117] Based on these findings, concurrent administration of trastuzumab with anthracyclines is not warranted.
