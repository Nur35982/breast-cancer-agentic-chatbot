In a meta-analysis, which included 12,779 patients from the trials, the 7-year recurrence rate was slightly reduced from 14.5% to 13.8% in the groups that received 5 years of an AI (RR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.81–0.99;P= .045).
The overall mortality rate at 7 years was 9.3% in the tamoxifen-followed-by-AI groups and 8.2% in the AI-alone groups (RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.78–1.03;P= .11).[60][Level of evidence A2] The mild androgen activity of exemestane prompted a randomized trial that evaluated whether exemestane might be preferable to anastrozole, in terms of its efficacy (i.e., EFS) and toxicity, as upfront therapy for postmenopausal women diagnosed with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer.[73][Level of evidence A1] TheMA27trial (NCT00066573) randomly assigned 7,576 postmenopausal women to receive 5 years of anastrozole or exemestane.At a median follow-up of 4.1 years, no difference in efficacy was seen (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.87–1.18;P= .86).[73][Level of evidence B1]The two therapies also were not significantly different in terms of impact on bone mineral density or fracture rates.[74][Level of evidence B1] At a median follow-up of 4.1 years, no difference in efficacy was seen (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.87–1.18;P= .86).[73][Level of evidence B1] The two therapies also were not significantly different in terms of impact on bone mineral density or fracture rates.[74][Level of evidence B1] In the Femara Versus Anastrozole Clinical Evaluation (FACE) study (NCT00248170), 4,136 patients with hormone receptor–positive disease were randomly assigned to receive either letrozole or anastrozole.[75]There was no significant difference in DFS (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.80–1.07;P= .3150) at the time of a final analysis that was conducted when there were 709 of the planned 959 events.There were no substantial differences in adverse events between the arms.
