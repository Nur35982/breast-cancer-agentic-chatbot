Results have been reported in abstract form; the primary study end point was IDFS.
Because a prespecified test for interaction between treatment assignment and menopausal status was significant (P= .004), the premenopausal and postmenopausal groups were analyzed separately.[82]In postmenopausal patients, there was no evidence of a benefit with the addition of chemotherapy (HR for endocrine therapy plus chemotherapy vs.
endocrine therapy, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.78–1.22; 5-year IDFS rate, 91.6% vs.
91.9%;P= .82).[82][Level of evidence B1]In premenopausal patients, however, there was evidence of a benefit from the addition of chemotherapy to endocrine therapy (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.38–0.76; 5-year IDFS rate, 94.2% vs.
