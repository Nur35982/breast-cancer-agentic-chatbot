At a 3-year median follow-up, the risk of recurrence and/or death was significantly reduced in patients receiving trastuzumab (3-year DFS rate, 89% vs.
78%; HR, 0.41;P= .01; 95% CI, 0.21–0.83).
The difference in OS (HR, 0.41) was not statistically significant (P= .07; 95% CI, 0.16–1.08).
Several studies have compared 6 months of trastuzumab administration to 12 months.[135-137]In an interim analysis of thePHAREtrial (NCT00381901), the 2-year DFS rate was 93.8% (95% CI, 92.6%–94.9%) in the 12-month group and 91.1% (89.7%–92.4%) in the 6-month group (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.05–1.56; noninferiority,P= .29).[135][Level of evidence A1]In the final analysis, after 704 events were observed, the adjusted HR was 1.08 (95% CI, 0.93–1.25), and the prespecified noninferiority HR of 1.15 was not excluded.Similar results were noted in a much smaller study of 481 patients led by the Hellenic Oncology Research Group.[136][Level of evidence A1]In contrast, thePERSEPHONEtrial (NCT00712140), which enrolled 4,088 patients who experienced 512 DFS events at the time of analysis, excluded its prespecified noninferiority margin (HR, 1.07; 90% CI, 0.93−1.24; noninferiority,P= .011).[137][Level of evidence A1] In an interim analysis of thePHAREtrial (NCT00381901), the 2-year DFS rate was 93.8% (95% CI, 92.6%–94.9%) in the 12-month group and 91.1% (89.7%–92.4%) in the 6-month group (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.05–1.56; noninferiority,P= .29).[135][Level of evidence A1]In the final analysis, after 704 events were observed, the adjusted HR was 1.08 (95% CI, 0.93–1.25), and the prespecified noninferiority HR of 1.15 was not excluded.
