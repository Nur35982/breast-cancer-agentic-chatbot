Evidence (T-DM1 for patients who have received preoperative HER2-targeted therapy.): In a phase III trial (KATHERINE[NCT01772472]), 1,486 women with HER2-positive disease who received a preoperative taxane-containing chemotherapy (with or without an anthracycline) along with trastuzumab with or without a second HER2 targeted agent, but who had residual disease after surgery, were randomly assigned to receive 14 cycles of adjuvant trastuzumab or T-DM1.
The primary end point was IDFS.[141][Level of evidence B1]At the time of a planned interim analysis, IDFS was significantly higher in the T-DM1 group than in the trastuzumab group (HRinvasive disease or death, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.39â€“0.64;P< .001; IDFS at 3 years, 88.3% vs.
