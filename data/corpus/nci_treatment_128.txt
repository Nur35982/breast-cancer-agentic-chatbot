Lymphovascular space invasion.
Large primary tumors.
Very close or positive deep margins of resection of the primary tumor.
In this high-risk group, radiation therapy can decrease locoregional recurrence, even among patients who receive adjuvant chemotherapy.[24] Patients with one to three involved nodes without any of the high-risk factors may be at a lower risk of local recurrence, and the value of routine use of adjuvant radiation therapy in this setting is an area of controversy.
Evidence (postoperative radiation therapy in patients with one to three involved lymph nodes): The 2005 EBCTCG meta-analysis of 42,000 women in 78 randomized treatment comparisons indicated that radiation therapy is beneficial, regardless of the number of lymph nodes involved.[1][Level of evidence A1]For women with node-positive disease postmastectomy and axillary clearance (removal of axillary lymph nodes and surrounding fat), radiation therapy reduced the 5-year local recurrence risk from 23% to 6% (absolute gain, 17%; 95% CI, 15.2%â€“18.8%).
