Common toxicities associated with alpelisib included hyperglycemia, diarrhea, nausea, anorexia, and rash.
Careful monitoring and management of hyperglycemia are required during alpelisib use.
The FDA approved alpelisib for use in combination with fulvestrant in advancedPIK3CA-mutated, HER2-negative hormone receptorâ€“positive breast cancer after previous endocrine therapy.
Elacestrant is an oral selective ER degrader (SERD).
It degrades ER alpha in a dose-dependent manner and inhibits estradiol-dependent ER-directed gene transcription and tumor growth, including in cells withESR1variants.ESR1variants result in estrogen-independent ER activation and, consequently, resistance to AIs, but not necessarily to SERDs and selective ER modulators.
