Radiation therapy is also considered for high-risk postmastectomy patients.
The main goal of adjuvant radiation therapy is to eradicate residual disease, reducing local recurrence and increasing breast cancer–specific survival.[1] For women who have breast-conserving surgery without radiation therapy, the risk of recurrence in the conserved breast is substantial (>20%) even in women with confirmed axillary lymph node–negative disease.[2] Although all trials assessing the role of radiation therapy in breast-conserving therapy have shown highly statistically significant reductions in local recurrence rate, no single trial has demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in mortality.
