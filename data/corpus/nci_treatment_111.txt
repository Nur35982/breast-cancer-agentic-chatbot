25% for breast-conserving surgery alone; RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.75â€“0.90).
Regarding radiation dosing and schedule, the following has been noted: Whole-breast radiation dose.Conventional whole-breast radiation therapy is delivered to the whole breast (with or without regional lymph nodes) in 1.8 Gy to 2 Gy daily fractions over 5 to 6.5 weeks to a total dose of 45 Gy to 50 Gy.
Radiation boost.A further radiation boost is commonly given to the tumor bed.
Two randomized trials conducted in Europe have shown that boosts of 10 Gy to 16 Gy reduce the risk of local recurrence from 4.6% to 3.6% at 3 years (P= .044),[4][Level of evidence B1] and from 7.3% to 4.3% at 5 years (P< .001).[5][Level of evidence B1] Results were similar after a median follow-up of 17.2 years.[6][Level of evidence B1] If a boost is used, it can be delivered either by external-beam radiation therapy, generally with electrons, or by using an interstitial radioactive implant.[7] Administering a radiation boost may, however, be associated with unfavorable quality-of-life outcomes.[8] Radiation schedule.Some studies show that a shorter fractionation schedule of 42.5 Gy over 3 to 4 weeks is a reasonable alternative for some patients with breast cancer.A noninferiority trial of 1,234 randomly assigned patients with node-negative invasive breast cancer analyzed locoregional recurrence rates with conventional whole-breast radiation therapy versus a shorter fractionation schedule.[9] The 10-year locoregional relapse rate among women who received shorter fractionation was not inferior to conventional whole-breast radiation therapy (6.2% for a shorter fractionation schedule vs.
