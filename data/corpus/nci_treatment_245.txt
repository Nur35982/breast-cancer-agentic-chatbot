The primary end point was DFS in the 3,208 patients who remained in the study after 2 years.
Secondary end points included OS, time to contralateral breast cancer, time to second primary cancer, fractures, and toxicity.[87]After 10 years of follow-up, there was no difference in DFS between the two arms (73.6% for the 2-year course vs.
73.9% for the 5-year course [HR, 0.99; 95% CI, 0.85â€“1.15;P= .90]).
In addition, there was no difference in OS, time to second primary cancer, and time to contralateral breast cancer between the arms.[87][Level of evidence B1]There was a trend toward more fractures in the 5-year arm (4.7% vs.
