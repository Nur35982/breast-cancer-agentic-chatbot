There were no significant differences in time-to-mastectomy, time-to-distant metastasis, breast cancer–specific survival, or survival between the two groups.
The 10-year overall survival (OS) rate was 67% (95% CI, 62%–72%) in the tamoxifen-plus-radiation group, and 66% (95% CI, 61%–71%) in the tamoxifen-alone group.
PRIME-II was a phase III trial of radiation omission.
A total of 1,326 women were randomly assigned to receive either whole-breast irradiation (n = 658) or no irradiation (n = 668).
Eligible women were aged 65 years or older and had hormone receptor–positive, node-negative, T1 or T2 primary breast cancer (with tumors measuring ≤3 cm in the largest dimension).
