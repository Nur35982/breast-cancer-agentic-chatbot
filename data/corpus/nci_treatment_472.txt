This combination was approved for use in this patient population as a result of the trial.[56,57] Evidence (pembrolizumab): Patients were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either pembrolizumab (200 mg every 3 weeks) and chemotherapy (nab-paclitaxel, paclitaxel, or gemcitabine plus carboplatin) or placebo and chemotherapy.
Randomization was stratified by the type of on-study chemotherapy (taxane or gemcitabine/carboplatin), PD-L1 expression at baseline (CPS â‰¥1 or <1), and previous treatment with the same class of chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting (yes or no).
Dual primary efficacy end points were PFS and OS assessed in the PD-L1 CPS of 10 or more, PD-L1 CPS of 1 or more, and ITT populations.
