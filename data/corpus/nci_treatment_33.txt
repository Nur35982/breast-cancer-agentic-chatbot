A high H/I ratio was statistically significantly associated with a decrease in late recurrence in patients who received extended letrozole therapy compared with those who did not (odds ratio, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.16–0.75;P= .007).[85] In a secondary analysis of the ATAC trial, the BCI was prognostic in patients with node-negative breast cancer for both early (years 0–5) and late (years 5–10) distant recurrence.
For patients with stage I HER2-negative hormone receptor–positive tumors, a high H/I ratio predicted significant rates of late distant recurrence.[86] The BCI has also been evaluated for predictive capability.[87]The BCI H/I ratio was evaluated for its ability to predict benefit from extended endocrine therapy in patients who participated in theaTTomtrial (NCT00003678).
