SLN biopsy alone is associated with less morbidity than axillary lymphadenectomy.[25-28] Evidence (SLN biopsy): ALMANAC, a randomized trial of 1,031 women compared SLN biopsy followed by ALND when the SLN was positive with ALND in all patients.[29][Level of evidence A3]Quality of life at 1 year (as assessed by the frequency of patients experiencing a clinically significant deterioration in the Trial Outcome Index of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast scale) was superior in the SLN biopsy group (23% deteriorating in the SLN biopsy group vs.
35% in the ALND group;P= .001).
Arm function was also better in the SLN group.
