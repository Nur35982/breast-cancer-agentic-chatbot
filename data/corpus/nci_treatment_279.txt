In a subset analysis, OS was significantly prolonged only in the patients with hormone receptor–negative disease.
Among those patients, the 5-year OS rate was 78.8% in the capecitabine group and 70.3% in the no-further-chemotherapy group (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.30–0.90).
In the capecitabine group, 73.4% of the patients experienced hand-foot syndrome of varying degrees of severity.
These approaches should be considered for patients with residual disease after preoperative therapy.
Patients may also consider participation in clinical trials of novel therapies.
Clinical trials for this patient population have includedEA1131(NCT02445391), a phase III clinical trial that randomly assigned patients with residual basal-like TNBC after preoperative therapy to receive either platinum-based chemotherapy or capecitabine, andS1418/BR006(NCT02954874), a phase III trial that evaluated the efficacy of pembrolizumab as adjuvant therapy for patients with residual TNBC (≥1 cm invasive cancer or residual nodes) after preoperative therapy.
