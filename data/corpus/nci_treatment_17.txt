Of note, both analyses (NSABP B-20 and S8814) were underpowered for any conclusive predictive analysis among patients identified as having an intermediate recurrence score.
Results from the prospective, randomizedTAILORxtrial (NCT00310180) indicate that chemotherapy is unlikely to provide substantial benefit to patients older than 50 years with ER-PR–positive and node-negative disease and a recurrence score of 11 to 25.[78] In this study, a low-risk score was defined as less than 11, an intermediate score was 11 to 25, and a high-risk score was greater than 25.
These cut points differ from those described above.Patients in this study with a low-risk score were found to have very low rates of recurrence at 5 years with endocrine therapy.[79]The invasive DFS (IDFS) rate was 93.8% at 5 years and 84.0% at 9 years.The rate of freedom from recurrence of breast cancer at a distant site was 99.3% at 5 years and 96.8% at 9 years.The rate of freedom from recurrence of breast cancer at a distant or local-regional site was 98.7% at 5 years and 95.0% at 9 years.The overall survival (OS) rate was 98.0% at 5 years and 93.7% at 9 years.In the middle-risk group in the TAILORx study (recurrence score, 11–25), 6,907 women were randomly assigned to endocrine therapy alone or endocrine therapy plus chemotherapy.[78] Of these, 3,399 women on the endocrine therapy-alone arm and 3,312 women on the endocrine therapy-plus-chemotherapy arm were available for an analysis according to the randomized treatment assignments.
