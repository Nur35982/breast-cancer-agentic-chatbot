Quality of life at 1 year (as assessed by the frequency of patients experiencing a clinically significant deterioration in the Trial Outcome Index of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast scale) was superior in the SLN biopsy group (23% deteriorating in the SLN biopsy group vs.
35% in the ALND group;P= .001).
Arm function was also better in the SLN group.
The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Projectâ€™s (NSABP-B-32[NCT00003830]) multicenter, phase III trial randomly assigned women (N = 5,611) to undergo either SLN plus ALND or SLN resection alone.
ALND was only performed if the SLNs were positive.[30][Level of evidence A1]The study showed no detectable difference in overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), and regional control.
