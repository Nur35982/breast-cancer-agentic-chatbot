Capecitabine therapy increased DFS when given after conventional adjuvant therapy.
Evidence (capecitabine therapy for patients who have not been treated with preoperative systemic therapy): TheSYSUCC-001trial (NCT01112826) included 443 women (434 analyzed) with TNBC from 13 Chinese institutions.
The women had received adjuvant chemotherapy and were randomly assigned to receive either no further therapy or capecitabine at a dose of 650 mg/m2twice daily for 1 year.
The primary study end point was DFS.[109]After a median follow-up of 61 months, the 5-year DFS rate was 82.5% for patients who received capecitabine maintenance therapy compared with 73.0% for patients who received no further therapy (HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.42â€“0.95;P= .03).[109][Level of evidence B1]Forty-five percent of patients who received capecitabine developed hand-foot syndrome, which was grade 3 in 7.7% of patients.The rate of patients who completed 1 year of therapy was 82.8%.
