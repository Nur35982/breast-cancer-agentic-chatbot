The overall rate of in-breast tumor recurrence was reduced from 31.7% to 15.7% when radiation therapy was delivered (P< .005).
Radiation therapy reduced the occurrence of invasive cancer from 16.8% to 7.7% (P= .001) and recurrent DCIS from 14.6% to 8.0% (P= .001).
Nine pathological features were evaluated for their ability to predict for in-breast recurrence, but only comedo necrosis was a significant predictor for recurrence.
Similarly, of the 1,010 patients enrolled in the EORTC-10853 trial, mammography detected lesions in 71% of the women.
Results were reported at a median follow-up of 10.5 years.[9][Level of evidence B1]The overall rate of in-breast tumor recurrence was reduced from 26% to 15% (P< .001), with a similarly effective reduction of invasive recurrence rates (13% to 8%,P= .065) and noninvasive recurrence rates (14% to 7%,P= .001).In this analysis, parameters associated with an increased risk of in-breast recurrence included age 40 years or younger, palpable disease, intermediate or poorly differentiated DCIS, cribriform or solid growth pattern, and indeterminate margins.
