Patients had residual disease after preoperative chemotherapy with anthracyclines, taxanes, or both, and 30% of the patients also had hormone receptor–negative disease.
The primary end point was DFS.[110] The study was terminated because of the results of a planned interim analysis, and a final analysis was done.In the final analysis, which included 887 eligible patients the 5-year DFS rate was 74.1% in the capecitabine group and 67.6% in the no-further-chemotherapy group (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.53–0.92;P= .01).[Level of evidence B1]OS was a secondary end point.
The 5-year OS rate was 89.2% in the capecitabine group and 83.6% in the no-further-chemotherapy group (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.39–0.90;P= .01).In a subset analysis, OS was significantly prolonged only in the patients with hormone receptor–negative disease.
