There was no difference in DFS when the two sequential arms were compared with 5 years of letrozole (letrozole to tamoxifen HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.91–1.23;P= .45 and tamoxifen to letrozole HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.92–1.25;P= .36).
TheFATA-GIM3trial (NCT00541086), which was not included in the meta-analysis, compared 2 years of tamoxifen followed by 3 years of one of the three AIs with 5 years of an AI.[72]No significant difference in the 5-year DFS rate was found between the two approaches (88.5% for switching; 89.8% for upfront AI; HR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.73–1.08;P= .23).
