PFS was significantly better on the higher-dose arm (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.68–0.94;P= .006).[47][Level of evidence B1] Adverse events and quality of life were similar on the two arms.
Conflicting results were found in two trials that compared the combination of the antiestrogen fulvestrant and anastrozole with anastrozole alone in the first-line treatment of hormone receptor–positive postmenopausal patients with recurrent or metastatic disease.
For more information, see theFulvestrantsection.[48,49] In both studies, fulvestrant was given as a 500-mg loading dose on day 1; 250 mg was given on days 15 and 29, and monthly thereafter; plus, 1 mg of anastrozole was given daily.
