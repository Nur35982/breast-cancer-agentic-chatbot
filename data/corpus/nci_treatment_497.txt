T-DM1 allows specific intracellular drug delivery to HER2-overexpressing cells, potentially improving the therapeutic index and minimizing exposure of normal tissue.
Evidence (T-DM1): The phase IIIEMILIAor TDM4370g study (NCT00829166) was a randomized open-label trial that enrolled 991 patients with HER2-overexpressing, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who were previously treated with trastuzumab and a taxane.[73][Level of evidence A1] Patients were randomly assigned to receive either T-DM1 or lapatinib plus capecitabine.Median PFS was 9.6 months with T-DM1 versus 6.4 months with lapatinib plus capecitabine (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.55â€“0.77;P< .001).Median OS was longer with T-DM1 versus lapatinib plus capecitabine (29.9 months vs.
