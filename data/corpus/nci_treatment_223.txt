(RR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.8–0.97;P= .01).[60][Level of evidence A2] Several trials and meta-analyses have examined the effect of switching to anastrozole or exemestane to complete a total of 5 years of therapy after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen.[65-67] The evidence, as described below, indicates that sequential tamoxifen and AI is superior to remaining on tamoxifen for 5 years.
Evidence (sequential tamoxifen and AI vs.
5 years of tamoxifen): Two trials carried out in sequence by the same group enrolled a total of 828 patients and were reported together; one trial used aminoglutethimide as the AI, and the other trial used anastrozole.[67]After a median follow-up of 78 months, an improvement in all-cause mortality (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42–0.88;P= .007) was observed in the AI groups.[67][Level of evidence A1] After a median follow-up of 78 months, an improvement in all-cause mortality (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.42–0.88;P= .007) was observed in the AI groups.[67][Level of evidence A1] Two other trials were reported together.[66] A total of 3,224 patients were randomly assigned after 2 years of tamoxifen to continue tamoxifen for a total of 5 years or to take anastrozole for 3 years.[67]There was a significant difference in EFS (HR, 0.80; 95% CI;P= .0009), but not in OS (5-year OS, 97% CI for the switched arm vs.
