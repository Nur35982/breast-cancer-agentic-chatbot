Twenty-nine percent of patients in the elacestrant arm and 31% of patients in the standard-of-care arm had received prior fulvestrant therapy.
Less than 5% of patients in either arm had received prior mTOR inhibitor therapy.[34]PFS was prolonged in the elacestrant arm in all patients (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.55–0.88;P= .002) and in elacestrant-treated patients withESR1variants (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.39–0.77;P= .0005).
Among all patients, 6-month PFS rates were 34.3% for patients in the elacestrant arm and 20.4% for patients in the standard-of-care arm.
In patients withESR1variants, 6-month PFS rates were 40.8% for patients in the elacestrant arm and 19.1% for patients in the standard-of-care arm.
