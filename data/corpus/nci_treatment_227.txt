The primary end points were DFS at 2.75 years and 5.0 years.[70][Level of evidence B1]The 5-year DFS rate was 85% in the sequential group and 86% in the exemestane-alone group (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.88–1.08;P= .60).
The 5-year DFS rate was 85% in the sequential group and 86% in the exemestane-alone group (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.88–1.08;P= .60).
Similarly in theIBCSG 1-98trial (NCT00004205), two sequential arms were compared with 5 years of letrozole.[71][Level of evidence B1]There was no difference in DFS when the two sequential arms were compared with 5 years of letrozole (letrozole to tamoxifen HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.91–1.23;P= .45 and tamoxifen to letrozole HR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.92–1.25;P= .36).
