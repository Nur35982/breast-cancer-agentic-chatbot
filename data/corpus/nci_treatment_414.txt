Sixty-millisecond increases were more common in patients receiving tamoxifen (16% on ribociclib and 7% on placebo).
The primary end point (investigator-assessed PFS) was met.
At the time of final analysis for PFS, the median PFS for the ribociclib group was 23.8 months versus 13.0 months in the placebo group (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.44–0.69;P< .0001).[17][Level of evidence A3] OS was a secondary end point.
The combination of ribociclib plus endocrine therapy was associated with longer OS than was endocrine therapy alone (42-month OS, 70.2% vs.
46%; HRdeath, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54−0.95;P= .01).[18][Level of evidence A1] The survival benefit was observed both in patients who received an AI plus goserelin and in those who received tamoxifen, but it was not statistically significant in the much-smaller tamoxifen group.
