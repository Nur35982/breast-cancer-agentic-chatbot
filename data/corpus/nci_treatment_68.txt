Lymph node status.
Estrogen-receptor and progesterone-receptor levels in the tumor tissue.
Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status in the tumor.
Tumor grade.
Menopausal status.
General health of the patient.
The standards used to define biomarker status are described as follows: Estrogen receptor (ER) expression:ER expression is measured primarily by immunohistochemistry (IHC).
Any staining of 1% of cells or more is considered positive for ER.[1] Progesterone receptor (PR) expression:PR expression is measured primarily by IHC.
Any staining of 1% of cells or more is considered positive for PR.
