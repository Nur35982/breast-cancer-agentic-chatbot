Patients were required to have clinically negative axillae.[12][Level of evidence A1]At 10 years, 98% of patients in the tamoxifen-plus-radiation group (95% CI, 96%–99%) were free from local and regional recurrences compared with 90% in the tamoxifen-alone group (95% CI, 85%–93%).There were no significant differences in time-to-mastectomy, time-to-distant metastasis, breast cancer–specific survival, or survival between the two groups.
The 10-year overall survival (OS) rate was 67% (95% CI, 62%–72%) in the tamoxifen-plus-radiation group, and 66% (95% CI, 61%–71%) in the tamoxifen-alone group.
