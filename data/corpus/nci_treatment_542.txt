Strontium chloride Sr 89, a systemically administered radionuclide, can be given for palliation of diffuse bony metastases.[149,150] The use of bone-modifying therapy to reduce skeletal morbidity in patients with bone metastases should be considered.[151] Results of randomized trials of pamidronate and clodronate in patients with bony metastatic disease show decreased skeletal morbidity.[152-154][Level of evidence A3] Zoledronate has been at least as effective as pamidronate.[155] The optimal dosing schedule for zoledronate was studied inCALGB-70604(Alliance; NCT00869206), which randomly assigned 1,822 patients, 855 of whom had metastatic breast cancer, to receive zoledronic acid every 4 weeks or every 12 weeks.[156] Skeletal-related events were similar in both groups, with 260 patients (29.5%) in the zoledronate every-4-week dosing group and 253 patients (28.6%) in the zoledronate every-12-week dosing group experiencing at least one skeletal-related event (risk difference of -0.3% [1-sided 95% CI, -4% to infinity];P< .001 for noninferiority).[156][Level of evidence B1] This study suggests that the longer dosing interval of zoledronate every 12 weeks is a reasonable treatment option.
