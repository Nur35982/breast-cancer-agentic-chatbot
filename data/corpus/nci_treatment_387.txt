Lancet 365 (9453): 60-2, 2005.[PUBMED Abstract] The frequency of follow-up and the appropriateness of screening tests after the completion of primary treatment for stage I, stage II, or stage III breast cancer remain controversial.
Evidence from randomized trials indicates that periodic follow-up with bone scans, liver sonography, chest x-rays, and blood tests of liver function doesnotimprove survival or quality of life when compared with routine physical examinations.[1-3] Even when these tests permit earlier detection of recurrent disease, patient survival is unaffected.[2] On the basis of these data, acceptable follow-up can be limited to the following for asymptomatic patients who complete treatment for stages I to III breast cancer: Physical examination.
