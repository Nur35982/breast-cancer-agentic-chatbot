Severe neutropenia was less frequent in patients who received the dose-dense regimens.[30][Level of evidence A1] An Italian trial (NCT00433420) compared two versus three weekly doses of epirubicin plus cyclophosphamide (with or without 5-FU) in a factorial design, with a result similar to a U.S.
intergroup trial; however, this trial also demonstrated a difference in OS.[31]For the dose-density comparison, the 5-year DFS rate was 81% (95% CI, 79%–84%) in patients treated every 2 weeks and 76% (95% CI, 74%–79%) in patients treated every 3 weeks (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.65–0.92;P= .004).Five-year OS rates were 94% (95% CI, 93%–96%) and 89% (95% CI, 87%–91%; HR, 0.65; 0.51–0.84;P= .001).[31][Level of evidence A1] For the dose-density comparison, the 5-year DFS rate was 81% (95% CI, 79%–84%) in patients treated every 2 weeks and 76% (95% CI, 74%–79%) in patients treated every 3 weeks (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.65–0.92;P= .004).
