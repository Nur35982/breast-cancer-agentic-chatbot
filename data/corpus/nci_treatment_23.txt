In an analysis based on the actual treatment received, the HR for IDFS was 1.14 (95% CI, 0.99â€“1.31;P= .06).
Outcomes for the other end points examined (freedom of distant breast cancer recurrence, freedom from local and distant recurrence, and OS) were similar between the two treatment arms and none were significant atP< .10.
There was a significant interaction between treatment assignment and age (P= .03) with respect to IDFS, suggesting that chemotherapy might be beneficial in women younger than 50 years with recurrence scores ranging from 11 to 25.
A secondary analysis of TAILORx demonstrated that integration of clinical risk (assessed by tumor size and grade) adds prognostic information to the recurrence score in women with a recurrence score of at least 11; however, clinical risk was not predictive of a chemotherapy benefit.[80] This secondary analysis further explored the interaction between age and chemotherapy benefit.
