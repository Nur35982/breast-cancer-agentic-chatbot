49%).
There were no differences between neoadjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant therapy in distant recurrence, breast cancer mortality, or death from any cause.
However, neoadjuvant therapy was associated with higher 15-year local recurrence rates (21.4% vs.
15.9%; relative risk [RR], 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17âˆ’1.61;P= .001).[3][Level of evidence A1] Pathological complete response (pCR) has been used as a surrogate end point for long-term outcomes, such as DFS, event-free survival (EFS), and OS, in preoperative clinical trials in breast cancer.
A pooled analysis (CTNeoBC) of 11 preoperative randomized trials (n = 11,955) determined that pCR, defined as no residual invasive cancer in the breast and axillary nodes with presence or absence ofin situcancer (ypT0/is ypN0 or ypT0 ypN0), was associated with improved outcomes compared with eradication of invasive tumor from the breast alone (ypT0/is).[4] pCR could not be validated in this study as a surrogate end point for improved EFS and OS.[4][Level of evidence C2] Because of a strong association between pCR and substantially improved outcomes in individual patients with more aggressive subtypes of breast cancer, the U.S.
