This translated into a significant reduction (P= .002) in breast cancer mortality, 54.7% versus 60.1%, with an absolute gain of 5.4% (95% CI, 2.9%–7.9%).In subgroup analyses, the 5-year local recurrence rate was reduced by 12% (95% CI, 8%–16%) for women with one to three involved lymph nodes and by 14% (95% CI, 10%–18%) for women with four or more involved lymph nodes.
In an updated meta-analysis of 1,314 women with axillary dissection and one to three positive nodes, radiation therapy reduced locoregional recurrence (2-sidedP< .00001), overall recurrence (RR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.57–0.82; 2-sidedP= .00006), and breast cancer mortality (RR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.67–0.95; 2-sidedP= .01).[25][Level of evidence A1]In contrast, for women at low risk of local recurrence with node-negative disease, the absolute reduction in 5-year local recurrence was only 4% (P= .002; 95% CI, 1.8%–6.2%), and there was not a statistically significant reduction in 15-year breast cancer mortality (absolute gain, 1.0%;P> .1; 95% CI, -0.8%–2.8%).
