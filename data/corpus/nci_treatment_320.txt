The goals of the trial were to determine if T-DM1 produced fewer clinically relevant toxicities and was associated with an acceptable 3-year IDFS rate.
The trial randomly assigned 383 patients to the T-DM1 arm and 114 patients to the paclitaxel and trastuzumab arm.[146]Although the types of toxicities differed in the two treatment arms, the total number of clinically relevant toxicities was nearly identical (46% in the T-DM1 arm vs.
47% in the paclitaxel and trastuzumab arm;P= .83).
However, patients who received T-DM1 reported more favorable outcomes during treatment.The 3-year IDFS rate for patients who received T-DM1 was 97.8% (95% CI, 96.3%â€“99.3%), which exceeded the protocol-specified rate of 95% to reject the null hypothesis (P= .0001).[146][Level of evidence C1] Results were similar at 5 years.[147] Although the types of toxicities differed in the two treatment arms, the total number of clinically relevant toxicities was nearly identical (46% in the T-DM1 arm vs.
