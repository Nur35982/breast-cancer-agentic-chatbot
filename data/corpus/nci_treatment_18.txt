After a median follow-up of 90 months, the difference in IDFS, the main study end point, met the prespecified noninferiority criterion (P> .10 for a test of no difference after 835 events had occurred) suggesting the noninferiority of endocrine therapy compared with endocrine therapy plus chemotherapy.In this population, the 9-year IDFS rate was 83.3% for endocrine therapy alone and 84.3% for endocrine therapy plus chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR], 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.94â€“1.24;P= .26).[78][Level of evidence B1]One hundred eighty-five patients in the endocrine-only arm received chemotherapy, and 608 patients in the endocrine therapy-plus-chemotherapy arm did not receive their assigned chemotherapy.
