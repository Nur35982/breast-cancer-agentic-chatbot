Median time to progression was 3.7 months in both groups (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.819−1.133;P= .65).[46][Level of evidence B1] The frequency of adverse events was similar in both groups, and there was no difference in quality of life.

CONFIRM(NCT00099437) was a double-blind phase III trial that compared two doses of fulvestrant (500 mg vs.
250 mg, each given in a loading-dose schedule) in 736 women whose disease had progressed on previous endocrine therapy.[47]PFS was significantly better on the higher-dose arm (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.68–0.94;P= .006).[47][Level of evidence B1]Adverse events and quality of life were similar on the two arms.
