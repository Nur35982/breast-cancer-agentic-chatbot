Five-year OS rates were 94% (95% CI, 93%–96%) and 89% (95% CI, 87%–91%; HR, 0.65; 0.51–0.84;P= .001).[31][Level of evidence A1] A meta-analysis of 26 randomized trials that included 37,298 women treated with anthracycline- and taxane-containing chemotherapy compared standard regimens (given every 3–4 weeks) with more dose-intense regimens.
Regimens that increased dose intensity by shortening the interval between cycles (i.e., dose-dense therapy or administration of the same dose over a shorter time period) and regimens that increased dose intensity by administering individual drugs in sequence to allow for higher doses (i.e., sequential scheduling).[32]Patients who received more dose-intense regimens had superior recurrence-free survival (RFS) (28.0% vs.
