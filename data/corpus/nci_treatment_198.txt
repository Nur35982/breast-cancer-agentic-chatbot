In these women, the 15-year absolute reduction associated with 5 years of use was 12% for recurrence and 9% for mortality.
Allocation to approximately 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen reduces the annual breast cancer death rate by 31%, largely irrespective of the use of chemotherapy, age (<50 years, 50–69 years, ≥70 years), progesterone receptor (PR) status, or other tumor characteristics.
The meta-analysis also confirmed the benefit of adjuvant tamoxifen in hormone receptor–positive premenopausal women.
Women younger than 50 years obtained a degree of benefit from 5 years of tamoxifen similar to that obtained by older women.
