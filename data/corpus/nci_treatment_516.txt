Diarrhea, nausea, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, and vomiting were the most common adverse events, with grade 3 diarrhea occurring in 24.4% of patients who received neratinib.
Antidiarrheal medications were required in the neratinib arm and used by 98.3% of those patients.
Quality-of-life scores were similar between the two groups.
Lapatinib is an orally administered TKI of both HER2 and the epidermal growth factor receptor.
Lapatinib plus capecitabine has shown activity in patients who have HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer that progressed after treatment with trastuzumab.
Evidence (lapatinib): A nonblinded randomized trial (GSK-EGF100151[NCT00078572]) compared the combination of capecitabine and lapatinib with capecitabine alone in 324 patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease that progressed after therapies that included anthracyclines, taxanes, and trastuzumab.[84][Level of evidence A1]Median time-to-disease progression in the lapatinib-plus-capecitabine arm was 8.4 months compared with 4.4 months in the capecitabine-alone arm (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.34–0.71;P< .001).There was no difference in OS (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.58–1.46;P= .72).[84][Level of evidence A1]Patients on combination therapy were more likely to develop diarrhea, rash, and dyspepsia.
