Patients with progressive disease during preoperative therapy may either transition to a non–cross-resistant regimen or proceed to surgery, if feasible.[11,12] Although switching to a non–cross-resistant regimen results in a higher pCR rate than continuing the same therapy, there is no clear evidence that other breast cancer outcomes are improved with this approach.
Most studies that support the use of chemotherapy were conducted after patients had surgery and prior to the widespread use of preoperative therapy.
In general, their results are still applicable to preoperative treatment, and these regimens are the ones most commonly used in the neoadjuvant space for this subtype.
