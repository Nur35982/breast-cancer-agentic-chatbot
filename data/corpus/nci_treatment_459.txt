TROP2 is a transmembrane calcium signal transducer highly expressed in HER2-negative ER-positive breast cancer.
Internalization of TROP2–bound sacituzumab govitecan delivers SN-38 into the tumor cell through hydrolysis of the linker.[51] Evidence (sacituzumab govitecan): The global phase IIITROPiCS-02trial (NCT03901339) randomly assigned 543 patients to receive either sacituzumab govitecan or physician’s choice chemotherapy (eribulin, vinorelbine, capecitabine, or gemcitabine).
Patients had locally recurrent inoperable or metastatic breast cancer that was endocrine-resistant, chemotherapy-treated, hormone receptor–positive, and HER2-negative.
