The median PFS was 16.4 months for the abemaciclib-fulvestrant arm versus 9.3 months for the placebo-fulvestrant arm (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.45–0.68;P< .001).[23][Level of evidence B1] OS data are mature and demonstrate an improvement in OS for patients receiving abemaciclib, and showed a median OS of 46.7 months for abemaciclib plus fulvestrant versus 37.3 months for placebo (HR, 0.757; 95% CI, 0.606–0.945;P= .01).[24][Level of evidence A1] Adverse events included diarrhea in the abemaciclib group (86.4%) and in the placebo group (24.7%), neutropenia (46% and 4%), nausea (45.1% and 22.9%), fatigue (39.9% and 26.9%), and abdominal pain (35.4% and 15.7%).These events were mostly grade 1 to 2.
