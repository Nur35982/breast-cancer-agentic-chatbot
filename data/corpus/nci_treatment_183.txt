There was a significant association between the drug administered and schedule for both DFS (0.003) and OS (0.01).
Thus, compared with paclitaxel given every 3 weeks, paclitaxel given weekly improved both DFS (OR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.01–1.57;P= .006) and OS (OR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.02–1.72;P= .01).
Docetaxel given every 3 weeks was also superior in DFS to paclitaxel given every 3 weeks (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.00–1.52;P= .02), but the difference was not statistically significant for OS (OR, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.88–1.46;P= .25).
Docetaxel given weekly was not superior to paclitaxel given every 3 weeks.
There was no stateda prioribasis for expecting that varying the schedule of administration would have opposite effects for the two drugs.
