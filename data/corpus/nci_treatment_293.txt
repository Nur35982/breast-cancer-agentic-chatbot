All three arms were associated with a low incidence of cardiac adverse events of 5% or less.
Because of these studies, the FDA granted accelerated approval of pertuzumab as part of a preoperative treatment for women with early-stage, HER2-positive breast cancer whose tumors are larger than 2 cm or node-positive.
The FDA approval of pertuzumab was subsequently converted to regular approval following the results of the confirmatoryAPHINITYtrial (NCT01358877), a randomized, phase III, adjuvant study for women with HER2-positive breast cancer.
Study results demonstrated improved IDFS with the combination of chemotherapy and dual HER2-targeted therapy with pertuzumab plus trastuzumab compared with chemotherapy and trastuzumab alone.[125] Pertuzumab is now approved both in combination with trastuzumab and chemotherapy for the neoadjuvant therapy of locally advanced, inflammatory, or early-stage HER2-positive breast cancer, which is larger than 2 cm or node-positive, as part of a complete treatment regimen and in combination with chemotherapy and trastuzumab as adjuvant treatment for HER2-positive early breast cancer at a high risk of recurrence.
