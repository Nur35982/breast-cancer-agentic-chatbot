At the time of final analysis for PFS, the median PFS for the ribociclib group was 23.8 months versus 13.0 months in the placebo group (HR, 0.55; 95% CI, 0.44–0.69;P< .0001).[17][Level of evidence A3]OS was a secondary end point.
The combination of ribociclib plus endocrine therapy was associated with longer OS than was endocrine therapy alone (42-month OS, 70.2% vs.
46%; HRdeath, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.54−0.95;P= .01).[18][Level of evidence A1] The survival benefit was observed both in patients who received an AI plus goserelin and in those who received tamoxifen, but it was not statistically significant in the much-smaller tamoxifen group.Adverse events were similar to those in other studies of CDK4/6 inhibitors.Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia occurred in 61% of patients in the ribociclib group and 4% of patients in the placebo group.The rate of febrile neutropenia was 2.0% in the ribociclib group and 1.0% in the placebo group.An increase in QTcF interval of more than 60 milliseconds from baseline was observed in 10.0 % of patients in the ribociclib arm and 2.0% in the placebo arm.
