Patients were randomly assigned to receive 2.5 mg of letrozole daily for 5 years or to an intermittent schedule in which there was a 3-month break at the end of each of the first 4 years, but not in the final year.[84]There was no observed advantage to the intermittent schedule with respect to DFS (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.93–1.26;P= .31) or in the frequency of adverse events.[84][Level of evidence B1] There was no observed advantage to the intermittent schedule with respect to DFS (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.93–1.26;P= .31) or in the frequency of adverse events.[84][Level of evidence B1] A phase III trial conducted by the Dutch Breast Cancer Study Group (DATA[NCT00301457]) randomly assigned 1,860 eligible receptor-positive postmenopausal women who had received 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen to receive either 3 or 6 years of anastrozole (1 mg daily).[85]At 3 years, 1,660 of these women were free of disease: among them, DFS was observed to be improved, but not statistically significantly so, on the extended-therapy arm (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.62–1.02).[85][Level of evidence B1] Myalgia and osteoporosis/osteopenia were more frequent on the extended-therapy arm.
