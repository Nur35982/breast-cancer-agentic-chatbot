Follow-up results at 8 years, however, did not demonstrate heterogeneity of treatment effect according to whether chemotherapy was administered, although recurrences were more frequent among patients who received chemotherapy.[54] A Korean Breast Cancer Study Group trial (NCT00912548) included 1,293 premenopausal women younger than 45 years, all of whom had received adjuvant chemotherapy and either retained ovarian function or regained it after 2 years of tamoxifen.
Patients were randomly assigned to receive either ovarian function suppression with goserelin plus tamoxifen or tamoxifen alone.[55]In the intent-to-treat analysis of 1,282 patients, the 5-year DFS rate was 89.8% for patients in the goserelin-plus-tamoxifen group and 87.3% for patients in the tamoxifen-alone group (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.49–0.98;P= .036).OS was a secondary end point and was also improved for patients in the goserelin-plus-tamoxifen group (HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.10–0.95;P= .039).[55][Level of evidence A1] In the intent-to-treat analysis of 1,282 patients, the 5-year DFS rate was 89.8% for patients in the goserelin-plus-tamoxifen group and 87.3% for patients in the tamoxifen-alone group (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.49–0.98;P= .036).
