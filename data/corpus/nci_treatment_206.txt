Pulmonary embolus: RR, 1.87 (95% CI, 1.13–3.07;P= .01).
Stroke: RR, 1.06 (95% CI, 0.83–1.36).
Ischemic heart disease: RR, 0.76 (95% CI, 0.6–0.95;P= .02).
Endometrial cancer: RR, 1.74 (95% CI, 1.30–2.34;P= .0002).
Notably, the cumulative risk of endometrial cancer during years 5 to 14 from breast cancer diagnosis was 3.1% for women who received 10 years of tamoxifen versus 1.6% for women who received 5 years of tamoxifen.
The mortality for years 5 to 14 was 12.2 versus 15 for an absolute mortality reduction of 2.8%.
The results of the ATLAS trial indicated that for women who remained premenopausal after 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen, continued tamoxifen for 5 more years was beneficial.[43] Women who have become menopausal after 5 years of tamoxifen may also be treated with AIs.
