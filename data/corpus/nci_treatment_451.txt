Adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in 15 patients (6.3%) in the elacestrant arm and 10 patients (4.4%) in the standard-of-care arm.
Epigenetic modification alters gene expression.
This can lead to endocrine therapy resistance and may be reversed by epigenetic modifiers such as histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors.
Entinostat, an oral HDAC inhibitor, induces downregulation of estrogen-independent growth factor signaling pathways and normalization of estrogen receptor levels.
Entinostat was evaluated in a phase III trial and showed no benefit.[35,36] With the PFS and OS advantages associated with combination therapy with targeted agents and endocrine therapy as discussed above, single-agent endocrine therapy is less frequently used, especially in the first-line setting.
