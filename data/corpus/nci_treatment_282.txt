74%) and pathological responses (breast and axilla, 38% vs.
19%) but also in EFS, the primary outcome.[114][Level of evidence A1]After a median follow-up of 5.4 years, the EFS benefit was 58% with the addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy (95% CI, 48%–66%) and 43% (95% CI, 34%–52%) in patients in the chemotherapy group.
The unadjusted HR for EFS between the two randomized HER2-positive treatment groups was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.44–0.93; two-sided log-rankP= .016).
EFS was strongly associated with pCR in patients who received trastuzumab.[115]Symptomatic cardiac failure occurred in two patients who received concurrent doxorubicin and trastuzumab for two cycles.
