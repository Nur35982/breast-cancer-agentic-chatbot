To date, immunotherapy monotherapy has not demonstrated an OS benefit for patients with metastatic TNBC.
Evidence (pembrolizumab): KEYNOTE-119(NCT02555657) was a phase III, randomized, open-label, multicenter, international trial that enrolled patients with metastatic TNBC.
Patients had received one or two previous systemic treatments for metastatic disease and had previous treatment with an anthracycline or taxane.
The trial randomly assigned 622 patients to receive intravenous pembrolizumab 200 mg once every 3 weeks for 35 cycles (pembrolizumab group), or to the investigator's choice of single-drug chemotherapy (capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine).
