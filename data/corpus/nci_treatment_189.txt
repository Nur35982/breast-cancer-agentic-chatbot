The primary aim was to determine if TC (the non-anthracycline arm) was noninferior to the TaxAC arms.
Inferiority for TC was predefined as an HR exceeding 1.18 for the TC versus TaxAC arms.
Participants were randomly assigned to receive TC (n = 2, 125) or TaxAC (n = 2,127).In an interim futility analysis, the HR for IDFS was 1.202 (95% CI, 0.97â€“1.49) for TC versus TaxAC, which exceeded the predetermined limit to define TC as inferior.The 4-year IDFS rate was 88.2% for patients who received TC and 90.7% for patients who received TaxAC (P= .04).Although the findings favored treatment with regimens containing an anthracycline/cyclophosphamide plus a taxane, absolute differences between TC and TaxAC were small.
