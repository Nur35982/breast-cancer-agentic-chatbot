The APBI arm was associated with less short-term but more long-term toxicity.[15][Level of evidence B1] TheNSABP B-39/RTOG 0413trial (NCT00103181) randomly assigned 4,216 women to whole-breast radiation therapy or APBI.[16] Whole-breast radiation therapy was delivered in 25 daily fractions of 50 Gy over 5 weeks, with or without a supplemental boost to the tumor bed, and APBI was delivered as 34 Gy of brachytherapy or 38.5 Gy of external-bream radiation therapy in 10 fractions, over 5 treatment days within an 8-day period.At a median follow-up of 10.2 years (interquartile range, 7.5–11.5), 90 of 2,089 women (4%) eligible for the primary outcome in the APBI group and 71 of 2,036 women (3%) in the whole-breast radiation therapy group had an ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (HR, 1.22; 90% CI, 0.94–1.58).
