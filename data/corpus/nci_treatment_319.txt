Evidence (combination regimens for node-negative, small, HER2-positive tumors): The single-arm Adjuvant Paclitaxel and Trastuzumab (APT) trial (NCT00542451) evaluated a non–anthracycline-containing regimen, paclitaxel and trastuzumab.
The trial enrolled 410 women with node-negative, small (≤3 cm), HER2-positive tumors.[144]After 6.5 years of follow-up, the DFS rate was 93% (95% CI, 90.4%–96.2%).[144][Level of evidence C2]The 10-year DFS rate was 91.3% (95% CI, 88.3%–94.4%).[145] After 6.5 years of follow-up, the DFS rate was 93% (95% CI, 90.4%–96.2%).[144][Level of evidence C2] The 10-year DFS rate was 91.3% (95% CI, 88.3%–94.4%).[145] TheATEMPTtrial (NCT01853748) compared paclitaxel and trastuzumab with T-DM1 in patients with node-negative HER2-positive tumors measuring 2 cm or smaller (patients with a single micrometastatic node were eligible).
