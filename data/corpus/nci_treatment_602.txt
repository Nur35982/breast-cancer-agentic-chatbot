Elsewhere, margins of less than 1 mm have been associated with an unacceptable local recurrence rate, even with radiation therapy.[10] In both studies, the effect of radiation therapy was consistent across all assessed risk factors.
The benefit of administering radiation therapy has been confirmed in a systematic review of four randomized trials (hazard ratio [HR], 0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.41â€“0.58;P< .00001).
In this study, the number needed to treat with radiation therapy was nine women to prevent one ipsilateral breast recurrence.[11] A large national clinical trial by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG-9804[NCT00003857]) comparing breast-conserving surgery and tamoxifen with or without radiation therapy was closed because of poor accrual (636 of planned 1,790 patients accrued).
