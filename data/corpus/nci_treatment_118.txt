The 10-year OS rate was almost identical in the two groups, at 80.8% (95% CI, 77.2%–84.3%) in the no-radiation therapy group and 80.7% (95% CI, 76.9%–84.3%) in the radiation therapy group.
Guidelines that address identifying appropriate candidates for partial breast irradiation have been published.[14] Evidence (partial breast irradiation): TheRAPIDtrial (NCT00282035) randomly assigned 2,135 women aged 40 years or older with ductal carcinomain situor node-negative breast cancer treated by breast-conserving surgery to receive either external-beam accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) (38.5 Gy in ten fractions delivered twice per day over 5–8 days) or whole-breast radiation therapy (42.5 Gy in 16 fractions delivered once per day over 21 days, or 50 Gy in 25 fractions once per day over 35 days).[15] Sixty-five ipsilateral breast tumor recurrences were observed, 37 in the APBI group, and 28 in the whole-breast irradiation group.In patients treated with APBI, the 5-year cumulative rate of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence was 2.3% (95% CI, 1.4%–3.2%) and the 8-year cumulative rate was 3.0% (95% CI, 1.9%–4.0%).In patients treated with whole-breast radiation therapy, the 5-year cumulative rate of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence was 1.7% (range, 0.9%–2.5%) and the 8-year cumulative rate was 2.8% (range, 1.8%–3.9%).The hazard ratio (HR) for APBI versus whole-breast radiation therapy was 1.27 (90% CI, 0.84–1.91).Thus, the upper bound of the estimated 90% CI did not exceed the noninferiority margin of 2.02.
