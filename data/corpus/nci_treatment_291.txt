The following results were observed: The pCR rates were 29% for docetaxel plus trastuzumab, 46% for docetaxel plus trastuzumab and pertuzumab, 17% for pertuzumab plus trastuzumab, and 24% for docetaxel plus pertuzumab.
Therefore, the highest pCR rate was seen in the preoperative treatment arm with dual HER2 blockade plus chemotherapy.
The addition of pertuzumab to the docetaxel-plus-trastuzumab combination did not appear to increase toxic effects, including the risk of cardiac adverse events.
Despite the high pCR rate observed with dual HER2 blockade plus chemotherapy, PFS and DFS rates were not improved, although the NeoSPHERE trial was not powered to detect differences in long-term efficacy outcomes.[123] The open-label, randomized, phase IITRYPHAENAtrial (NCT00976989) sought to evaluate the tolerability and activity associated with trastuzumab and pertuzumab.[124][Level of evidence B3] All 225 women with tumors that were larger than 2 cm or node positive, and who had operable, locally advanced, or inflammatory HER2-positive breast cancer, were randomly assigned to one of three preoperative regimens:Concurrent FEC plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab (×3) followed by concurrent docetaxel plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab.FEC alone (×3) followed by concurrent docetaxel plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab (×3).Concurrent docetaxel and carboplatin plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab (×6).The following results were observed:The pCR rate was equivalent across all three treatment arms: (62% for concurrent FEC plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab followed by concurrent docetaxel plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab; 57% for FEC alone followed by concurrent docetaxel plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab; and 66% for concurrent docetaxel and carboplatin plus trastuzumab plus pertuzumab).All three arms were associated with a low incidence of cardiac adverse events of 5% or less.
