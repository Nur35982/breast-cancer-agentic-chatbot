Patients with stable or asymptomatic CNS disease were included.[83][Level of evidence B1]Patients who received neratinib and capecitabine had significantly improved PFS (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63–0.93).
OS between the two arms was not different.The cumulative incidence of intervention for CNS disease was 22.8% (95% CI, 15.5%–30.9%) for patients who received neratinib versus 29.2% (95% CI, 22.5%–36.1%) for patients who received lapatinib.Duration of response was 8.5 months for patients who received neratinib versus 5.6 months for patients who received lapatinib.Diarrhea, nausea, palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, and vomiting were the most common adverse events, with grade 3 diarrhea occurring in 24.4% of patients who received neratinib.
