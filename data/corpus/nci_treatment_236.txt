The primary study end point was DFS.At a median follow-up of 6.3 years, DFS was significantly improved in patients randomly assigned to receive letrozole (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.48–0.91;P= .01).
The 5-year DFS rate was improved from 91% to 95%.[81][Level of evidence B1]OS rates showed no difference (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.73–1.28;P= .83).
More patients who received letrozole had fractures (14%) than did patients who received placebo (9%) (P= .001).QOL was assessed with the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36) and Menopause-Specific QOL (MENQOL) instruments.
More than 85% of participants completed yearly assessments over a 5-year period.No between-group differences were found on the four MENQOL subscales or on the SF-36 summary score.SF-36 role-emotional and bodily pain scores were statistically significantly worse (P= .03) among patients receiving letrozole, but the differences observed were fewer than the minimum clinically important differences for the SF-36 instrument.
