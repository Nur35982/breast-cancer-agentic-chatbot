CDK4 and CDK6 have been implicated in the continued proliferation of hormone receptor–positive breast cancer that is resistant to endocrine therapy.
CDK inhibitors, in combination with endocrine therapy, have been approved by the FDA in both first-line and later-line treatment of patients with advanced, HER2-negative, hormone receptor–positive breast cancer and are now being studied in the adjuvant setting.
Abemaciclib is currently the only FDA-approved CDK inhibitor in the adjuvant setting.
Evidence (CDK inhibitors in the adjuvant setting): ThemonarchEtrial (NCT03155997) examined the effect of adding abemaciclib to standard endocrine therapy in women with HER2-negative hormone receptor–positive breast cancer who were at high risk of recurrence.[89] The trial enrolled 5,637 women who met one of the following criteria: four or more positive nodes; or one to three positive nodes and either tumor size 5 cm or larger, histological grade 3, or central Ki67 20% or greater.
