The HR for OS was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.7–1.02;P= .08).[69] After the second planned interim analysis, when median follow-up for patients on the study was 30.6 months, the results were released because of a highly significant (P< .005) difference in DFS (HR, 0.68) favoring the exemestane arm.[68] After a median follow-up of 55.7 months, the HR for DFS was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66–0.88;P= .001) in favor of exemestane.[69][Level of evidence A1] At 2.5 years after random assignment, 3.3% fewer patients on exemestane had developed a DFS event (95% CI, 1.6–4.9).
The HR for OS was 0.85 (95% CI, 0.7–1.02;P= .08).[69] In a meta-analysis, which included 11,798 patients from six trials, the 10-year recurrence rate was reduced from 19% to 17% in the AI-containing groups (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.75–0.91;P= .0001).
