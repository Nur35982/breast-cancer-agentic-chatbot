The primary end point (investigator-assessed PFS) was met.
At the time of final analysis for PFS, the median PFS for the ribociclib group was 20.5 months versus 12.8 months in the placebo group (HR, 0.593; 95% CI, 0.480–0.732;P< .001).[15][Level of evidence B1] OS was superior in the ribociclib group (HR, 0.724; 95% CI, 0.568–0.924;P= .004).
The result crossed the prespecified stopping boundary (P= .011) for superior efficacy.
Results were similar in all subgroups.[16][Level of evidence A1] Adverse events were similar to those in other studies of CDK4/6 inhibitors.Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia occurred in 53.4% of patients in the ribociclib group and 0.0% of patients in the placebo group.The rate of febrile neutropenia was 1.0% in the ribociclib group and 0% in the placebo group.An increase in QTcF interval of more than 60 milliseconds from baseline was observed in 6.5% of patients in the ribociclib arm and 0.4% in the placebo arm.
