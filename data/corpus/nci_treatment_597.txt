Comedo.
Comedo-type DCIS consists of cells that appear cytologically malignant, with the presence of high-grade nuclei, pleomorphism, and abundant central luminal necrosis.
Comedo-type DCIS appears to be more aggressive, with a higher probability of associated invasive ductal carcinoma.[3] Treatment options for DCIS include: Breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy plus radiation therapy with or without tamoxifen.
Total mastectomy with or without tamoxifen.
In the past, the customary treatment for DCIS was mastectomy.[4] The rationale for mastectomy included a 30% incidence of multicentric disease, a 40% prevalence of residual tumor at mastectomy after wide excision alone, and a 25% to 50% incidence of in-breast recurrence after limited surgery for palpable tumor, with 50% of those recurrences being invasive carcinoma.[4,5] The combined local and distant recurrence rate after mastectomy is 1% to 2%.
