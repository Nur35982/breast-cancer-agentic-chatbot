5 months; HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.49–0.78;P< .001).
Adverse events occurred as expected.
Adverse events that were potentially immune-related were more frequent in the atezolizumab arm.
The primary PFS analysis from IMpassion131 revealed that adding atezolizumab to paclitaxel did not improve investigator-assessed PFS in the PD-L1–positive population.
The median PFS was 6.0 months for patients who received atezolizumab and paclitaxel compared with 5.7 months for patients who received placebo and paclitaxel (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.60–1.12;P= .20).[60]The final OS results showed no difference between the treatment arms.
