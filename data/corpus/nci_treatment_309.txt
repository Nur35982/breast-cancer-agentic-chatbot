In the final analysis, after 704 events were observed, the adjusted HR was 1.08 (95% CI, 0.93–1.25), and the prespecified noninferiority HR of 1.15 was not excluded.
Similar results were noted in a much smaller study of 481 patients led by the Hellenic Oncology Research Group.[136][Level of evidence A1] In contrast, thePERSEPHONEtrial (NCT00712140), which enrolled 4,088 patients who experienced 512 DFS events at the time of analysis, excluded its prespecified noninferiority margin (HR, 1.07; 90% CI, 0.93−1.24; noninferiority,P= .011).[137][Level of evidence A1] TheSOLDtrial (NCT00593697) compared 9 weeks of trastuzumab with 1 year of trastuzumab in 2,174 women with HER2-positive breast cancer.[138]Noninferiority of the 9-week treatment could not be demonstrated for DFS (HR, 1.39; 2-sided 90% CI, 1.12−1.72).[138][Level of evidence B1] Noninferiority of the 9-week treatment could not be demonstrated for DFS (HR, 1.39; 2-sided 90% CI, 1.12−1.72).[138][Level of evidence B1] A meta-analysis that included these trials concluded that, with respect to OS, 1 year of trastuzumab was superior to a shorter duration of therapy; however, there was no significant benefit of 1 year of therapy in patients with low-risk disease.[139][Level of evidence A1] Several studieshave evaluated the use of SQ trastuzumab in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings.
