Evidence of mTOR inhibitor activity in HER2-positive breast cancer was shown in the double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase IIIBOLERO-3trial (NCT01007942).[85] In the BOLERO-3 trial, 569 patients with HER2-positive, trastuzumab-resistant, breast cancer, who had received previous taxane therapy, were randomly assigned to receive either everolimus plus trastuzumab plus vinorelbine, or placebo plus trastuzumab plus vinorelbine.[85][Level of evidence B1]At median follow-up of 20.2 months, median PFS was 7.0 months in the everolimus group versus 5.78 months in the placebo group (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65â€“0.95;P= .0067).Serious adverse events were reported in 117 patients (42%) in the everolimus group and 55 patients (20%) in the placebo group.Final OS outcomes for this trial have not yet been reported.
