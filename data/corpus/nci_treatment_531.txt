The study enrolled 28 patients with metastatic breast cancer and high TMB.
TMB ranged from 9 to 37 Mut/Mb.
Disease control was noted in 37% of patients, with objective response noted in 21% of patients.
The median PFS was 10.6 weeks and the median OS was 30.6 weeks.
Patients receiving hormone therapy whose tumors have progressed are candidates for cytotoxic chemotherapy.
There are no data suggesting that combination therapy results in an OS benefit over single-agent therapy.
Patients with hormone receptorâ€“negative tumors and those with visceral metastases or symptomatic disease are also candidates for cytotoxic agents.[92] Single agents that have shown activity in metastatic breast cancer include: Anthracyclines.Doxorubicin.Epirubicin.Liposomal doxorubicin.[93-96]Mitoxantrone.
