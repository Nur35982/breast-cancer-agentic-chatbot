A high H/I ratio was statistically significantly associated with a decrease in late recurrence in patients who received extended letrozole therapy compared with those who did not (odds ratio, 0.35; 95% CI, 0.16–0.75;P= .007).[85]In a secondary analysis of the ATAC trial, the BCI was prognostic in patients with node-negative breast cancer for both early (years 0–5) and late (years 5–10) distant recurrence.
For patients with stage I HER2-negative hormone receptor–positive tumors, a high H/I ratio predicted significant rates of late distant recurrence.[86] The H/I expression ratio has been shown to predict DFS in patients with tamoxifen-treated, hormone receptor–positive, node-negative breast cancer.[84] The prognostic ability of the H/I ratio regarding late recurrence and treatment benefit was evaluated in the MA.17 trial.
