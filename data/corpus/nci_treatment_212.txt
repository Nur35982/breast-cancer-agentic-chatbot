OS was a secondary end point and was also improved for patients in the goserelin-plus-tamoxifen group (HR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.10–0.95;P= .039).[55][Level of evidence A1] AIs have been compared with tamoxifen in premenopausal women in whom ovarian function was suppressed or ablated.
The results of these studies have been conflicting.
Evidence (comparison of an AI with tamoxifen in premenopausal women): In one study (NCT00295646), 1,803 women who received goserelin were randomly assigned to a 2 × 2 factorial design trial that compared anastrozole and tamoxifen, with or without zoledronic acid.[56]At a median follow-up of 62 months, there was no difference in DFS (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.81–1.44;P= .59).OS was superior with tamoxifen (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.08–2.83;P= .02).
