No between-group differences were found on the four MENQOL subscales or on the SF-36 summary score.
SF-36 role-emotional and bodily pain scores were statistically significantly worse (P= .03) among patients receiving letrozole, but the differences observed were fewer than the minimum clinically important differences for the SF-36 instrument.
A randomized phase III study assessed the effect of an additional 2.5 years of letrozole versus 5 years of letrozole in 1,824 women who received 5 years of an AI.[Level of evidence B1] [82]DFS events were similar in both groups (HR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.74–1.16).
The distant metastasis-free interval was also similar (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.78–1.45).A subgroup analysis did not identify patients who benefited from 5-year extended therapy.This study did not show that 10 years of AI therapy was superior to 7.5 years of AI therapy.
