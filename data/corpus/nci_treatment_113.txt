6.7% for whole-breast radiation therapy with absolute difference, 0.5 percentage points; 95% CI, −2.5 to 3.5).[9][Level of evidence B1 Similarly, a combined analysis of the randomized United Kingdom Standardisation of Breast Radiotherapy trials (START), (START-A [ISRCTN59368779]) and START-B [ISRCTN59368779]) revealed no difference in a 10-year locoregional relapse rate.
These trials collectively randomly assigned 4,451 women with completely excised invasive (pT1–3a, pN0–1, M0) early-stage breast cancer after breast-conserving surgery to receive conventional whole-breast radiation therapy dosing or shorter fractionation.[10][Level of evidence B1] A meta-analysis that included the three trials mentioned above plus six others confirmed that differences with respect to local recurrence or cosmesis between shorter and conventional fractionation schedules were neither statistically nor clinically significant.[11] Additional studies are needed to determine whether shorter fractionation is appropriate for women with higher nodal disease burden.[10] The omission of radiation therapy after breast-conserving surgery has been tested in older patients with early-stage (T1 and small T2), hormone receptor–positive tumors after primary surgery.
