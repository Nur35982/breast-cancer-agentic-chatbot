89.0%;P= .0004).
OS was also significantly improved in patients who received endocrine therapy plus chemotherapy (HR, 0.47; 95% CI, 0.24–0.94;P= .032).[Level of evidence A1] The West German Study GroupPlan Btrial (NCT01049425) compared two chemotherapy regimens in patients with node-positive (pN1) or high-risk node-negative disease.
Chemotherapy was not offered to patients with recurrence scores below 12, but they were followed.
For a full description of the chemotherapy regimens, seePostoperative systemic therapy for HER2-negative hormone receptor–positive breast cancer.The 5-year DFS rates were very high in the 348 patients who did not receive chemotherapy and did not differ between node-negative patients (94.5%) and pN1 patients (94.9%).[83][Level of evidence C1] The 5-year DFS rates were very high in the 348 patients who did not receive chemotherapy and did not differ between node-negative patients (94.5%) and pN1 patients (94.9%).[83][Level of evidence C1] The prognostic ability of the BCI has been described in multiple trials.[84-86]The H/I expression ratio has been shown to predict DFS in patients with tamoxifen-treated, hormone receptor–positive, node-negative breast cancer.[84]The prognostic ability of the H/I ratio regarding late recurrence and treatment benefit was evaluated in the MA.17 trial.
