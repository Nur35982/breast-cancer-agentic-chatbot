Cardiac mortality decreased accordingly.[37,38]An analysis of the National Cancer Instituteâ€™s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) data from 1973 to 1989 that reviewed deaths caused by ischemic heart disease in women who received breast or chest wall radiation showed that since 1980, no increased death rate resulting from ischemic heart disease in women who received left chest wall or breast radiation was found.[39,40][Level of evidence C1]A population-based case-control study evaluated major coronary events (i.e., myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or death from ischemic heart disease) in 2,168 women who underwent radiation therapy for breast cancer.
