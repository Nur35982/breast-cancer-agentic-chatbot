Evidence (anthracycline/taxaneâ€“based chemotherapy regimen): In an effort to improve on the results observed with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC) alone, theNSABP B-27trial (NCT00002707) was conducted.
Patients were randomly assigned to receive (1) four cycles of preoperative AC followed by surgery, (2) four cycles of AC followed by four cycles of docetaxel and then surgery, or (3) four cycles of AC followed by surgery and then four cycles of docetaxel.[13][Level of evidence B1]The administration of preoperative AC followed by docetaxel was associated with a higher clinical complete response rate compared with the administration of AC alone (63.6% for AC followed by docetaxel and 40.1% for AC alone;P< .001); a higher pCR rate was also observed (26.1% for AC followed by docetaxel and 13.7% for AC alone;P< .001).
