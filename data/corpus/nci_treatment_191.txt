Exploratory analyses suggested the greatest benefits from the TaxAC regimens were seen in patients with triple-negative disease and hormone receptor–positive disease with involved axillary lymph nodes, supporting a role for non–anthracycline-containing regimens in patients with lower-risk disease.
The West GermanPlan Btrial (NCT01049425) randomly assigned 2,499 women with node-positive or high-risk node-negative disease to receive either four cycles of epirubicin/cyclophosphamide plus four cycles of docetaxel (EC-T) or six cycles of TC.[34] After an early amendment, women with hormone receptor–positive disease and a recurrence score below 12 were excluded.After a median follow-up of 60 months, 5-year outcomes were similar in the EC-T and TC arms for DFS (HR, 1.004; 95% CI, 0.776–1.299) and OS (HR, 0.937; 95% CI, 0.654–1.342).[34][Level of evidence B1]The upper 90% confidence limit for DFS did not exceed the noninferiority boundary of 1.467.There were five treatment-related deaths among patients who received TC and one death among those who received EC-T, but symptomatic adverse events were more frequent in patients who received EC-T.
