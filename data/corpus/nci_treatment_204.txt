Study results revealed that 10 years of tamoxifen reduced the risk of breast cancer recurrence (617 recurrences for 10 years of tamoxifen vs.
711 recurrences for 5 years of tamoxifen;P= .002), reduced breast cancer mortality (331 deaths for 10 years of tamoxifen vs.
397 deaths for 5 years of tamoxifen;P= .01), and reduced overall mortality (639 deaths for 10 years of tamoxifen vs.
722 deaths for 5 years of tamoxifen;P= .01).
Of note, from the time of the original breast cancer diagnosis, the benefits of 10 years of therapy were less extreme before than after year 10.
At 15 years from the time of diagnosis, breast cancer mortality was 15% at 10 years and 12.2% at 5 years.
