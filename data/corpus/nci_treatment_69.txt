HER2 expression:HER2 is measured primarily by either IHC to assess expression of the HER2 protein or byin situhybridization (ISH) to assess gene copy number.
The American Society of Clinical Oncology/College of American Pathologists consensus panel has published guidelines for cases when either IHC or ISH testing is equivocal.[2]IHC:Negative: 0 or 1+ stainingEquivocal: 2+ stainingPositive: 3+ stainingISH (dual probe):Possible negative results:HER2/chromosome enumeration probe (CEP17) ratio <2.0ANDHER2copy number <4Possible equivocal results: (requires performing alternative ISH test to confirm equivocal or IHC if not previously performed)HER2/CEP17 ratio <2.0ANDHER2copy number ≥4 but <6Possible positive results:HER2/CEP17 ratio ≥2.0 by ISHHER2copy number ≥6 regardless of ratio by ISHISH (single probe):Negative: <4HER2copiesEquivocal: ≥4but <6 HER2copiesPositive: ≥6HER2copies IHC: Negative: 0 or 1+ staining Equivocal: 2+ staining Positive: 3+ staining ISH (dual probe): Possible negative results:HER2/chromosome enumeration probe (CEP17) ratio <2.0ANDHER2copy number <4 HER2/chromosome enumeration probe (CEP17) ratio <2.0ANDHER2copy number <4 Possible equivocal results: (requires performing alternative ISH test to confirm equivocal or IHC if not previously performed)HER2/CEP17 ratio <2.0ANDHER2copy number ≥4 but <6 HER2/CEP17 ratio <2.0ANDHER2copy number ≥4 but <6 Possible positive results:HER2/CEP17 ratio ≥2.0 by ISHHER2copy number ≥6 regardless of ratio by ISH HER2/CEP17 ratio ≥2.0 by ISH HER2copy number ≥6 regardless of ratio by ISH ISH (single probe): Negative: <4HER2copies Equivocal: ≥4but <6 HER2copies Positive: ≥6HER2copies The AJCC has designated staging by TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) classification to define breast cancer.[3] The grade of the tumor is determined by its morphologic features, such as tubule formation, nuclear pleomorphism, and mitotic count.
