However, research has increasingly shown that repeat radiation therapy may be feasible and safe in select patient populations.[8] Mastectomy with or without breast reconstruction.
Survival is equivalent with any of these options, as documented in the EORTC-10801 trial [9] and other prospective randomized trials.[10-16] Also, a retrospective study of 753 patients who were divided into three groups based on hormone receptor status (ER positive or PR positive; ER negative and PR negative but HER2 positive; and triple negative) found no differences in disease control within the breast in patients treated with standard breast-conserving surgery; however, there are not yet substantive data to support this finding.[17] The rate of local recurrence in the breast after conservative treatment is low and varies slightly with the surgical technique used (e.g., lumpectomy, quadrantectomy, segmental mastectomy, and others).
