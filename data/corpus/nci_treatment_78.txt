Whether completely clear microscopic margins are necessary has been debated.[18-20] However, a multidisciplinary consensus panel recently used margin width and ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence from a meta-analysis of 33 studies (N = 28,162 patients) as the primary evidence base for a new consensus regarding margins in patients with stage I and stage II breast cancer treated with breast-conserving surgery plus radiation therapy.
Results of the meta-analysis include the following:[21] Positive margins (ink on invasive carcinoma or ductal carcinomain situ) were associated with a twofold increase in the risk of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence compared with negative margins.
