This controversial issue requires further evaluation.[139] The potential for anthracycline-induced cardiac toxic effects should be considered in the selection of chemotherapeutic regimens for selected patients.
Recognized risk factors for cardiac toxicity include: Advanced age.
Previous chest-wall radiation therapy.
Previous anthracycline exposure.
Hypertension and known underlying heart disease.
Diabetes.
The cardioprotective drug dexrazoxane decreased the risk of doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity in patients in controlled studies.
The use of this agent has permitted patients to receive higher cumulative doses of doxorubicin and has allowed patients with cardiac risk factors to receive doxorubicin.[140-143] The risk of cardiac toxicity may also be reduced by giving doxorubicin as a continuous intravenous infusion.[144] The American Society of Clinical Oncology guidelines suggest the use of dexrazoxane in patients with metastatic cancer who have received a cumulative dose of doxorubicin of 300 mg/m2or more when further treatment with an anthracycline is likely to be of benefit.[145] Dexrazoxane has a similar protective effect in patients receiving epirubicin.[146] TheECOG 2108trial (NCT01242800) evaluated the potential benefit of breast locoregional interventions in patients with metastatic breast cancer.
