4.9 months, favoring margetuximab).The median follow-up was 20.2 months.
The median OS in the ITT population was not statistically different between the two treatment groups: 21.6 months in the margetuximab group and 21.9 months in the trastuzumab group (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.77–1.17;P= .620).Grade 3 or higher adverse events that occurred in at least 5% of patients included decreased neutrophil count and anemia in both groups, fatigue in the margetuximab group, and febrile neutropenia in the trastuzumab group.
Margetuximab improved primary PFS over trastuzumab with a 24% relative risk reduction (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59–0.98;P= .03) (median PFS, 5.8 months vs.
