TheDPYDgene encodes an enzyme that catabolizes pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines, like capecitabine and fluorouracil.
An estimated 1% to 2% of the population has germline pathogenic variants inDPYD, which lead to reduced DPD protein function and an accumulation of pyrimidines and fluoropyrimidines in the body.[132,133] Patients with theDPYD*2Avariant who receive fluoropyrimidines may experience severe, life-threatening toxicities that are sometimes fatal.
Many otherDPYDvariants have been identified, with a range of clinical effects.[132-134] Fluoropyrimidine avoidance or a dose reduction of 50% may be recommended based on the patient'sDPYDgenotype and number of functioningDPYDalleles.[135-137]DPYDgenetic testing costs less than $200, but insurance coverage varies due to a lack of national guidelines.[138] In addition, testing may delay therapy by 2 weeks, which would not be advisable in urgent situations.
