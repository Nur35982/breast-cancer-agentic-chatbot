The 6-month PFS rate was 50% in the abemaciclib-plus-fulvestrant group and 37% in the fulvestrant-alone group (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.57–0.95).[25][Level of evidence B1] Overall response rate, a secondary end point, was 17% in the abemaciclib-plus-fulvestrant group and 7% in the fulvestrant-alone group.
