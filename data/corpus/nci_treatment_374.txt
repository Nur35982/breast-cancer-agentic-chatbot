This rate was significantly higher than the rate observed in women who were treated with surgery alone (hazard ratio, 6.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3–36.1).[9] Cardiac events associated with adjuvant trastuzumab have been reported in multiple studies.
Key study results include the following: In the HERA (BIG-01-01) trial, severe congestive heart failure (CHF) (New York Heart Association class III–IV) occurred in 0.6% of patients treated with trastuzumab.[10] Symptomatic CHF occurred in 1.7% of patients in the trastuzumab arm and 0.06% of patients in the observation arm.
In theNSABP B-31trial (NCT00004067), 31 of 850 patients in the trastuzumab arm had confirmed symptomatic cardiac events, compared with 5 of 814 patients in the control arm.[11] The 3-year cumulative incidence of cardiac events for trastuzumab-treated patients was 4.1%, compared with 0.8% of patients in the control arm (95% CI, 1.7%–4.9%).
