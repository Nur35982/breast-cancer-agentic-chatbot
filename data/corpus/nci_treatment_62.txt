Clin Cancer Res 27 (1): 311-319, 2021.[PUBMED Abstract] Table 1describes the histological classification of breast cancer based on tumor location.[1] Infiltrating or invasive ductal cancer is the most common breast cancer histological type and comprises 70% to 80% of all cases.
Lobular carcinoma is the second most common breast cancer histological type, comprising 10% to 15% of all cases.
Lobular carcinoma has characteristics that define a natural history distinct from that of ductal carcinoma (seeFigure 2).
This cellular distinction leads to variation in imaging modality utility, pathological diagnostic criteria, metastatic pattern of spread, timing of metastatic presentation, and sensitivity to antineoplastic therapeutics.
