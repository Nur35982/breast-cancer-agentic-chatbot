Median OS did not differ between the two groups (22.3 months vs.
19.5 months; HRdeath, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.55â€“1.06;P= .11), although survival data are not yet mature.
The primary toxicity observed with talazoparib was myelosuppression, especially anemia.
Patient-reported outcome data demonstrated more favorable effects of talazoparib than standard chemotherapy on quality-of-life measures.[88] For more information, seeGenetics of Breast and Gynecologic Cancers.
An established biomarker for checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy is high somatic tumor mutational burden (TMB).
TMB is the number of mutations within the coding region of a tumor genome and is reported as mutations per megabase (Mut/Mb).
