Among those patients, the 5-year OS rate was 78.8% in the capecitabine group and 70.3% in the no-further-chemotherapy group (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.30–0.90).In the capecitabine group, 73.4% of the patients experienced hand-foot syndrome of varying degrees of severity.
In the final analysis, which included 887 eligible patients the 5-year DFS rate was 74.1% in the capecitabine group and 67.6% in the no-further-chemotherapy group (HR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.53–0.92;P= .01).[Level of evidence B1] OS was a secondary end point.
The 5-year OS rate was 89.2% in the capecitabine group and 83.6% in the no-further-chemotherapy group (HR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.39–0.90;P= .01).
