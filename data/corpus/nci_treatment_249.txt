The women were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to standard-of-care adjuvant endocrine therapy with or without open-label abemaciclib (150 mg twice daily for 2 years).
The primary end point was IDFS and secondary end points included DRFS, OS, and safety.At a median follow-up of 54 months, an analysis showed that adding abemaciclib resulted in a substantial improvement in IDFS (5-year IDFS: 76% vs.
83.6%; HR, 0.680; 95% CI, 0.599–0.772;P< .001) and DRFS (5-year DRFS: 79.2% vs.
86%; HR, 0.675; 95% CI, 0.588–0.774;P< .001).There were 208 deaths in the abemaciclib arm and 234 deaths in the endocrine therapy-alone arm.
