Patients had previously undergone breast-conserving surgery with clear excision margins and adjuvant endocrine therapy.[13][Level of evidence A1]At a median follow-up of 10 years, the cumulative incidence of local breast cancer recurrence was 9.5% (95% CI, 6.8%–12.3%) in the no-radiation therapy group and 0.9% (95% CI, 0.1%–1.7%) in the radiation therapy group.
The 10-year OS rate was almost identical in the two groups, at 80.8% (95% CI, 77.2%–84.3%) in the no-radiation therapy group and 80.7% (95% CI, 76.9%–84.3%) in the radiation therapy group.
