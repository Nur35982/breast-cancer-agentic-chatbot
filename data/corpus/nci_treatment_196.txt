Evidence (tamoxifen for hormone receptor–positive early breast cancer): The EBCTCG performed a meta-analysis of systemic treatment of early breast cancer by hormone, cytotoxic, or biological therapy methods in randomized trials involving 144,939 women with stage I or stage II breast cancer.
An analysis published in 2005 included information on 80,273 women in 71 trials of adjuvant tamoxifen.[21][Level of evidence A1]In this analysis, the benefit of tamoxifen was found to be restricted to women with hormone receptor–positive or hormone receptor–unknown breast tumors.
In these women, the 15-year absolute reduction associated with 5 years of use was 12% for recurrence and 9% for mortality.Allocation to approximately 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen reduces the annual breast cancer death rate by 31%, largely irrespective of the use of chemotherapy, age (<50 years, 50–69 years, ≥70 years), progesterone receptor (PR) status, or other tumor characteristics.The meta-analysis also confirmed the benefit of adjuvant tamoxifen in hormone receptor–positive premenopausal women.
