53.2%;P= .005) in patients with TNBC.
Patients withBRCA1orBRCA2variants had a higher rate of pCR, which was not increased by the addition of carboplatin (66.7% in the nonplatinum arm vs.
65.7% in the platinum-containing arm).
The 3-year DFS rate was higher for patients with TNBC randomly assigned to the carboplatin arm (86.1% vs.
75.8%; HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.34âˆ’0.93), but OS did not differ.[104] The more intensive regimen was also associated with increased toxicity and treatment discontinuations (39% vs.
48%).
TheCALGB 40603trial (NCT00861705) compared an anthracycline/taxane backbone alone with an anthracycline/taxane backbone plus carboplatin in patients with stage II and stage III TNBC.[105][Level of evidence B3]The pCR rate for the breast and axilla was 54% for the anthracycline/taxane backbone-plus-carboplatin group versus 41% for the anthracycline/taxane backbone-alone group (P= .0029).
