Cytological or histological documentation of recurrent disease is obtained whenever possible.
When therapy is selected, the estrogen-receptor (ER) status, progesterone-receptor (PR) status, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status at the time of recurrence and previous treatment are considered, if known.
ER status may change at the time of recurrence.
In a single small study by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (MDA-MBDT-8081), 36% of hormone receptorâ€“positive tumors were found to be receptor negative in biopsy specimens isolated at the time of recurrence.[6] Patients in this study had no interval treatment.
