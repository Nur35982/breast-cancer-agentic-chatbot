Patients were randomly assigned to either discontinue anastrozole or continue it for 5 years.
The primary end point was DFS.[88]In an analysis done after all patients had completed protocol therapy, DFS was improved in the continued-therapy group (5-year DFS rate, 91% vs.
86%; HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.46–0.83;P< .0010).[88][Level of evidence B1]There was no difference in distant DFS or OS.
