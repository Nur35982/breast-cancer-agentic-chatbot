In an analysis conducted after a median follow-up of 100 months among hormone receptor–positive patients, DFS was significantly (P= .003) longer in patients on anastrozole (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76–0.94), but OS was not improved (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.86–1.11;P= .7).[62]Patients on tamoxifen more frequently developed endometrial cancer and cerebrovascular accidents, whereas patients on anastrozole had more fracture episodes.
The frequency of myocardial infarction was similar in both groups.
Except for a continued increased frequency of endometrial cancer in the tamoxifen group, these differences did not persist in the posttreatment period.[62] With a median follow-up of 33.3 months, no benefit in DFS was observed for the combination arm relative to tamoxifen alone.[61] Patients on anastrozole, however, had a significantly longer DFS (HR, 0.83) than those on tamoxifen.
