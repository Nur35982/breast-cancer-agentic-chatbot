Lobular carcinoma characteristics include, but are not limited to, the following:[3] Absence of E-cadherin expression, which can lead to a more linear, rather than mass-like, growth pattern.
This pattern can make mammography less sensitive and increases breast magnetic resonance imaging utility in assessing extent of disease in the breast.
Less usual patterns of metastatic spread, including, but not limited to, pleural, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, and peritoneal metastatic involvement.
Higher likelihood of estrogen-receptor expression.
Lower sensitivity of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging for detection of disease.
