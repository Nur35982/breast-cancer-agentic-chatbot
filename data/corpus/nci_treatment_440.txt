In patients who received capivasertib and fulvestrant, the most frequent grade 3 or higher adverse events were rash (12.1%) and diarrhea (9.3%).
Grade 3 or higher rash and diarrhea occurred in 0.3% of patients who received placebo and fulvestrant.
Adverse events sometimes led to treatment discontinuation.
