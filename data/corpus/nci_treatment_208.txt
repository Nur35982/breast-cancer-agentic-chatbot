However, updated results with a median follow-up of 8 years, demonstrated improved DFS with tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression compared with tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62–0.93;P= .009); the 8-year DFS rate was 83.2% in the tamoxifen-plus-ovarian-suppression group versus 78.9% in the tamoxifen-alone group.In addition, OS at 8 years was improved with tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression compared with tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.48–0.92;P= .01); the 8-year OS rate was 93.3% in the tamoxifen-plus-ovarian-suppression group versus 91.5% in the tamoxifen-alone group.Despite overall negative initial results, subgroup analysis suggested a benefit with ovarian suppression in women who underwent chemotherapy and remained premenopausal afterwards.
