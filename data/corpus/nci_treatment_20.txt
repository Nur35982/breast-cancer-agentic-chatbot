Among women aged 50 years or younger, rates of distant recurrence were lower with chemotherapy for patients with recurrence scores of 16 to 20 and high clinical risk.
Rates were also lower for patients with recurrence scores of 21 to 25, regardless of clinical risk.Most women received tamoxifen as their endocrine therapy.
It is not certain if any of the observed benefits of chemotherapy are attributable to ovarian function suppression and if they could be achieved through endocrine therapy.
Patients in this study with a low-risk score were found to have very low rates of recurrence at 5 years with endocrine therapy.[79] The invasive DFS (IDFS) rate was 93.8% at 5 years and 84.0% at 9 years.
