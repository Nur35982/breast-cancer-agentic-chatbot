no chemotherapy, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.50–1.21;P= .27) Patients in the low clinical risk group with high genomic risk did well, and there was little evidence of benefit from chemotherapy in this group (5-year survival without distant metastases, 95.8% with chemotherapy vs.
95.0% without; HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.59–2.28;P= .66).
