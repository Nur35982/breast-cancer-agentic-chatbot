This difference in the pattern of recurrence was of borderline statistical significance (P= .07).
Further analyses revealed that differences in recurrence patterns persisted for most subgroups except for those who had either negative tumor margins or one to three positive lymph nodes.
For these two subgroups, sequence assignment made little difference in local or distant recurrence rates, although the statistical power of these subgroup analyses was low.
Potential explanations for the increase in distant recurrence noted in the radiation-first group are that chemotherapy was delayed for a median of 17 weeks after surgery, and that this group received lower chemotherapy dosages because of increased myelosuppression.
