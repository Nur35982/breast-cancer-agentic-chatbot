ALND and axillary radiation therapy provided excellent and comparable axillary control for patients with T1 or T2 primary breast cancer and no palpable lymphadenopathy who underwent breast-conserving therapy or mastectomy.
The use of axillary radiation therapy was also associated with significantly less morbidity.
For patients who require an ALND, the standard evaluation usually involves only a level I and II dissection, thereby removing a satisfactory number of nodes for evaluation (i.e., at least 6â€“10), while reducing morbidity from the procedure.
Although SLN biopsy has been the standard for the axillary staging of patients with invasive breast cancer and a clinically negative axilla, two randomized controlled trials have identified populations for which SLN biopsy could be omitted.
