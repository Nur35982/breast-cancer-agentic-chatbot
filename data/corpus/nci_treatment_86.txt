Of those with detailed radiation records available for review, 43 patients (18.9%) received regional nodal radiation therapy.[31]The 5-year DFS rate was 82.2% (95% CI, 78.3%–86.3%) with ALND and 83.9% (95% CI, 80.2%–87.9%) with SLN biopsy alone.
At a median follow-up of 6.3 years, the 5-year OS rate was 91.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 89.1%–94.5%) with ALND and 92.5% (95% CI, 90.0%–95.1%) with SLN biopsy alone.
Detailed analysis of the radiation field design found that 15% of patients also received treatment to the supraclavicular region (in addition to standard tangents).
