Because of the results of an EBCTCG analysis, the use of tamoxifen in women who received adjuvant chemotherapy does not attenuate the benefit of chemotherapy.[21] However, concurrent use of tamoxifen with chemotherapy is less effective than sequential administration.[44] Evidence suggests ovarian ablation alone is not an effective substitute for other systemic therapies.[45-49] Further, the addition of ovarian ablation to chemotherapy and/or tamoxifen has not been found to significantly improve outcomes.[47,49-52] Evidence (tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression): The largest study (SOFT[NCT00066690]) to examine the addition of ovarian ablation to tamoxifen with or without chemotherapy randomly assigned 2,033 premenopausal women (53% of whom had received previous chemotherapy) to receive tamoxifen or tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression with triptorelin or ablation with surgery or radiation therapy.[53][Level of evidence B1]Upon initial report, with a median follow-up of 5.6 years, there was no significant difference in the primary outcome of DFS (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.66â€“1.04;P= .10); the 5-year DFS rate was 86% in the tamoxifen-plus-ovarian-suppression group versus 84.7% in the tamoxifen-alone group.
