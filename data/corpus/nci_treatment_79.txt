More widely clear margins were not found to significantly decrease the rate of ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence compared with no ink on tumor.
Thus, it was recommended that the use of no ink on tumor be the new standard for an adequate margin in invasive cancer.
There was no evidence that more widely clear margins reduced ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence for young patients or for those with unfavorable biology, lobular cancers, or cancers with an extensive intraductal component.
For patients undergoing partial mastectomy, margins may be positive after primary surgery, often leading to re-excision.
