Antidiarrheal medications were required in the neratinib arm and used by 98.3% of those patients.Quality-of-life scores were similar between the two groups.
Patients who received neratinib and capecitabine had significantly improved PFS (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.63–0.93).
OS between the two arms was not different.
The cumulative incidence of intervention for CNS disease was 22.8% (95% CI, 15.5%–30.9%) for patients who received neratinib versus 29.2% (95% CI, 22.5%–36.1%) for patients who received lapatinib.
Duration of response was 8.5 months for patients who received neratinib versus 5.6 months for patients who received lapatinib.
