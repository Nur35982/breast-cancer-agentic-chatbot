The primary end point was investigator-assessed progression-free survival (PFS).[11]The median PFS was 24.8 months in the palbociclib-plus-letrozole group compared with 14.5 months in the placebo-plus-letrozole group (hazard ratio [HR], 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46â€“0.72;P< .001).[11][Level of evidence B1]Overall survival (OS) data are not yet mature.Patients who received palbociclib experienced more frequent cytopenias (66.4% grade 3 to 4 in palbociclib-treated patients vs.
1.4% in placebo-treated patients).
Other common adverse events included nausea, arthralgia, fatigue, and alopecia.
