The primary end point was IDFS.At the time of the second interim analysis, no significant difference between the treatment arms was found (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.76â€“1.15; 3-year IDFS rates, 88.2% vs.
88.5%;P= .51).[93][Level of evidence B1] The planned final analysis yielded similar results.[94]As the test statistic for futility crossed the prespecified boundary, the data safety monitoring committee recommended that patients discontinue palbociclib therapy.Neutropenia and leukopenia were much more common in patients on the palbociclib arm, and fatigue was slightly more common.
There were no treatment-related deaths.
