At 3 years, 1,660 of these women were free of disease: among them, DFS was observed to be improved, but not statistically significantly so, on the extended-therapy arm (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.62–1.02).[85][Level of evidence B1] Myalgia and osteoporosis/osteopenia were more frequent on the extended-therapy arm.
A phase III, open-label, Italian trial (NCT01064635) included 2,056 hormone receptor–positive postmenopausal women who had received 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen treatment.
Patients were randomly assigned to receive letrozole for either 2 to 3 years (control) or 5 years (extended therapy).
The primary end point was IDFS.[86]After 11.7 years of follow-up, the 12-year DFS rate was 62% in the control group and 67% in the extended-therapy group (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65–0.93;P= .0064).
