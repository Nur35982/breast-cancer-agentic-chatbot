The trial included 708 patients: 289 patients (40.8%) hadPIK3CA/AKT/PTENpathway alterations and 489 (69.1%) received a prior CDK4/6 inhibitor for advanced breast cancer.
Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either capivasertib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant.
The dual primary end point was investigator-assessed PFS which was measured both in the overall population and in patients withPIK3CA/AKT/PTENpathway–altered tumors.[32]In the overall population, the median PFS was 7.2 months in the capivasertib-fulvestrant group versus 3.6 months in the placebo-fulvestrant group (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.51–0.71;P< .001).[32][Level of evidence B1]In thePIK3CA/AKT/PTENpathway-altered population, the median PFS was 7.3 months in the capivasertib-fulvestrant group and 3.1 months in the placebo-fulvestrant group (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.38–0.65;P< .001).In patients who received capivasertib and fulvestrant, the most frequent grade 3 or higher adverse events were rash (12.1%) and diarrhea (9.3%).
