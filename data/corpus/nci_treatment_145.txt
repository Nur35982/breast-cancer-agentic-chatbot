Contralateral breast cancer.One report suggested an increase in contralateral breast cancer for women younger than 45 years who received chest wall radiation therapy after mastectomy.[46] No increased risk of contralateral breast cancer occurred in women aged 45 years and older who received radiation therapy.[47] Techniques to minimize the radiation dose to the contralateral breast are used to keep the absolute risk as low as possible.[48] Risk of second malignancy.The rate of second malignancy after adjuvant radiation therapy is very low.
Sarcomas in the treated field are rare, with a long-term risk of 0.2% at 10 years.[49] In nonsmokers, the risk of lung cancer as a result of radiation exposure during treatment is minimal when current dosimetry techniques are used.
