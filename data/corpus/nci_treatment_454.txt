Median PFS was 16.6 months in the fulvestrant group and 13.8 months in the anastrozole group (HR, 0.797; 95% CI, 0.637−0.999;P= .049).[41][Level of evidence B1] The frequency of adverse events was similar in the two groups, and there was no difference in quality of life.
OS results were not reported.
Evidence (second-line fulvestrant): Two randomized trials that enrolled 400 and 451 patients whose disease had progressed after they received tamoxifen demonstrated that fulvestrant yielded results similar to those of anastrozole in terms of its impact on PFS.[42,43] The proper sequence of these therapies is not known.[44,45] EFECT(NCT00065325) was a phase III, double-blind, randomized trial that compared fulvestrant given in a loading-dose regimen (500 mg day 0, 250 mg days 14 and 28, and 250 mg every 28 days thereafter) with exemestane (25 mg) in women who had developed progressive disease after previous nonsteroidal AI (anastrozole or letrozole) therapy.[46] The trial randomly assigned 351 women to receive fulvestrant and 342 women to receive exemestane.Median time to progression was 3.7 months in both groups (HR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.819−1.133;P= .65).[46][Level of evidence B1]The frequency of adverse events was similar in both groups, and there was no difference in quality of life.OS results were not reported.
