Compared with ductal carcinoma, lobular carcinoma has a lower level of fluorine F 18-fludeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) uptake on PET and is detected at a significantly lower sensitivity.[4-6]One series demonstrated a mean maximum standard uptake value of 18F-FDG in invasive lobular carcinoma (1.99 ± 1.72) that was significantly lower compared with invasive ductal carcinoma (3.91 ± 3.99) (P= .032).[4,5]In another series, the relative risk of PET-computed tomography revealing unsuspected distant metastases in patients with stage III invasive ductal carcinoma was 1.98 times (95% confidence interval, 0.98–3.98) that of patients with stage III invasive lobular carcinoma (P= .049).[6] One series demonstrated a mean maximum standard uptake value of 18F-FDG in invasive lobular carcinoma (1.99 ± 1.72) that was significantly lower compared with invasive ductal carcinoma (3.91 ± 3.99) (P= .032).[4,5] In another series, the relative risk of PET-computed tomography revealing unsuspected distant metastases in patients with stage III invasive ductal carcinoma was 1.98 times (95% confidence interval, 0.98–3.98) that of patients with stage III invasive lobular carcinoma (P= .049).[6] More frequent diagnoses at later stages and a greater likelihood of lymph node involvement.
