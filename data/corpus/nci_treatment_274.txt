The primary end point was DFS.[108]At a median follow-up of 62 months, the 5-year DFS rate was 86.5% for patients who received PCb and 80.3% for patients who received CEF-T (HR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.44–0.96;P= .03).[108][Level of evidence B1]There was no statistically significant difference in OS between the groups (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.42–1.22;P= .22).
