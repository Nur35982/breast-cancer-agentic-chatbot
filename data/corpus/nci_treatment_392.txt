For patients in this subset, surgery and/or radiation therapy may be curative.[8,9] Patients with chest wall recurrences of less than 3 cm, axillary and internal mammary node recurrence (not supraclavicular, which has a poorer survival), and a greater-than-2-year disease-free interval before recurrence have the best chance for prolonged survival.[9] The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate in one series of such patients was 25%, with a 10-year rate of 15%.[10] The locoregional control rate was 57% at 10 years.
Systemic therapy should be considered in patients with locoregional recurrence.
Breast: In the Chemotherapy as Adjuvant for Locally Recurrent Breast Cancer (CALOR[NCT00074152]) trial, patients with a history of breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy with clear margins and complete excision of an isolated local recurrence of their breast cancer were randomly assigned to receive either chemotherapy of the physician's choice or no chemotherapy.
