Several studies sought to determine whether decreasing the duration between chemotherapy cycles could improve clinical outcomes.
The overall results of these studies support the use of dose-dense chemotherapy for women with HER2-negative breast cancer.
Evidence (administration of dose-dense chemotherapy in women with HER2-negative breast cancer): A U.S.
intergroup trial (CALGB-9741[NCT00003088]) of 2,005 node-positive patients compared, in a 2 Ã— 2 factorial design, the use of concurrent AC followed by paclitaxel with sequential doxorubicin, paclitaxel, and cyclophosphamide given every 2 weeks with filgrastim or every 3 weeks.[28][Level of evidence A1]At a median follow-up of 68 months, dose-dense treatment improved DFS, the primary end point, in all patient populations (HR, 0.80;P= .018), but not OS (HR, 0.85;P= .12).[29][Level of evidence A1]There was no interaction between density and sequence.Severe neutropenia was less frequent in patients who received the dose-dense regimens.[30][Level of evidence A1] At a median follow-up of 68 months, dose-dense treatment improved DFS, the primary end point, in all patient populations (HR, 0.80;P= .018), but not OS (HR, 0.85;P= .12).[29][Level of evidence A1] There was no interaction between density and sequence.
