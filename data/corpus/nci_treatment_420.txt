Patients receiving palbociclib had more-frequent fatigue, nausea, and headache.A prespecified analysis of OS was made after 310 patients had died.
A 6.9 month difference in median OS favoring the palbociclib-fulvestrant arm (34.9 months vs.
28.0 months) was found, which did not reach statistical significance (HR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.64–1.03;P= .09).[22]In a preplanned subgroup analysis, improved OS was observed in patients who had demonstrated sensitivity to hormone therapy (HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.55−0.94), whereas in patients without sensitivity, OS was not improved in the palbociclib group (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.71−1.84;P= .12 for interaction).
