21.3%; RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.83–0.92;P< .0001) at 10 years.
The difference was present and statistically significant in receptor-positive and receptor-negative subgroups.
Patients who received more dose-intense regimens had superior recurrence-free survival (RFS) (28.0% vs.
31.4%; RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.82–0.89;P< .0001) and OS (18.9% vs.

The difference was present and statistically significant in receptor-positive and receptor-negative subgroups.
