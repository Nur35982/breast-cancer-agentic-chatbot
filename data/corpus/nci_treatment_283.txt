Close cardiac monitoring of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and the total dose of doxorubicin not exceeding 180 mg/m2accounted for the relatively low number of declines in LVEF and only two cardiac events.
For more information, see theCardiac Toxic Effects With Adjuvant Trastuzumabsection.[114][Level of evidence B1] Study results confirmed that the addition of trastuzumab to preoperative chemotherapy resulted not only in improved clinical responses (87% vs.
74%) and pathological responses (breast and axilla, 38% vs.
19%) but also in EFS, the primary outcome.[114][Level of evidence A1] After a median follow-up of 5.4 years, the EFS benefit was 58% with the addition of trastuzumab to chemotherapy (95% CI, 48%–66%) and 43% (95% CI, 34%–52%) in patients in the chemotherapy group.
