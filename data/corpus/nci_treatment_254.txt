Neutropenia (62.15% vs.
4.5%) and liver-related events (25.4% vs.
10.6%) were more common in the ribociclib-plus-nonsteroidal AI group than the nonsteroidal AI-alone group.
A total of 477 patients discontinued ribociclib, and 554 patients had dose reductions.
There were no treatment-related deaths.
ThePALLAStrial (NCT02513394) studied the effect of adding palbociclib to standard adjuvant therapy in women with stage II to stage III HER2-negative hormone receptorâ€“positive breast cancer.[93] In the trial, 5,760 women who were within 6 months of initiating adjuvant endocrine therapy were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio without blinding to receive palbociclib plus endocrine therapy or to continue endocrine therapy alone.
