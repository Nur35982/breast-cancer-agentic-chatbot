In the FINHER trial, none of the patients who received trastuzumab experienced clinically significant cardiac events.
LVEF was preserved in all of the women receiving trastuzumab, but the number of patients receiving adjuvant trastuzumab was very low.[13] Evidence (cardiac toxic effects with pertuzumab and lapatinib): A pooled analysis of cardiac safety in 598 cancer patients treated with pertuzumab was performed using data supplied by Roche and Genentech.[14][Level of evidence C2]Asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction was observed in 6.9% of patients receiving pertuzumab alone (n = 331; 95% CI, 4.5%–10.2%), 3.4% of patients receiving pertuzumab in combination with a non–anthracycline-containing chemotherapy (n = 175; 95% CI, 1.3%–7.3%), and 6.5% of patients receiving pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab (n = 93; 95% CI, 2.4%–13.5%).Symptomatic heart failure was observed in one patient (0.3%) who received pertuzumab alone, two patients (1.1%) who received pertuzumab in combination with a non–anthracycline-containing chemotherapy, and one patient (1.1%) who received pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab.
