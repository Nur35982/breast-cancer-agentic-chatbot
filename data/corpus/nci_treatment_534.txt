An ECOG intergroup study (E-1193) randomly assigned patients to receive paclitaxel and doxorubicin, given both as a combination and sequentially.[121] Although response rate and time to disease progression were both better for the combination, survival was the same in both groups.[121][Level of evidence A1]; [122,123] The selection of therapy in individual patients is influenced by the following factors: Rate of disease progression.
Presence or absence of comorbid medical conditions.
Physician/patient preference.
Sequential use of single agents or combinations can be used for patients who relapse with metastatic disease.
