One year of trastuzumab also improved OS (12-year OS rate, 79% vs.
73%; HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.64–0.86;P< .0001).[129][Level of evidence A1] The following results were observed for patients assigned to 1 year of trastuzumab versus patients assigned to 2 years of trastuzumab: After a median follow-up of 11 years, there was no DFS benefit to an additional year of trastuzumab (HR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.89–1.17).
Symptomatic cardiac events occurred in 1% of the patients who received trastuzumab and in 0.1% of the observation group.
In the combined analysis of theNSABP-B-31(NCT00004067) and intergroupNCCTG-N9831(NCT00005970) trials, trastuzumab was given weekly, concurrently, or immediately after the paclitaxel component of the AC with paclitaxel regimen.[130,131][Level of evidence A1]The HERA results were confirmed in a joint analysis of the two studies, with a combined enrollment of 3,676 patients.
