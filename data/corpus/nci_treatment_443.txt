The primary end point was PFS in the cohort of patients withPIK3CAvariants.
In this cohort, median PFS was 11 months in the alpelisib-plus-fulvestrant arm compared with 5.7 months in the placebo-plus-fulvestrant arm (HRprogressionor HRdeath, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.50âˆ’0.85;P< .001).
PFS did not differ between arms in the cohort of participants withoutPIK3CAvariants (median PFS, 7.4 months in the alpelisib-plus-fulvestrant arm vs.
5.6 months in the placebo-plus-fulvestrant arm).
OS in the cohort withPIK3CAvariants was a secondary end point.
OS data are not yet mature.
Very few study participants had received previous CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy.
