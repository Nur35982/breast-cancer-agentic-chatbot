Elsewhere, margins of less than 1 mm have been associated with an unacceptable local recurrence rate, even with radiation therapy.[10]In both studies, the effect of radiation therapy was consistent across all assessed risk factors.
The overall rate of in-breast tumor recurrence was reduced from 26% to 15% (P< .001), with a similarly effective reduction of invasive recurrence rates (13% to 8%,P= .065) and noninvasive recurrence rates (14% to 7%,P= .001).
In this analysis, parameters associated with an increased risk of in-breast recurrence included age 40 years or younger, palpable disease, intermediate or poorly differentiated DCIS, cribriform or solid growth pattern, and indeterminate margins.
