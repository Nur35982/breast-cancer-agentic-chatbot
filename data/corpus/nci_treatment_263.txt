At least four pathologically confirmed positive lymph nodes were required for ER- and/or PR-positive/HER2-negative patients.
Eligibility criteria for patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery Patients with TNBC had residual invasive cancer in the breast and/or resected lymph nodes (i.e., no pCR).
ER- and/or PR-positive/HER2-negative patients had residual invasive cancer in the breast and/or resected lymph nodes (i.e., no pCR) AND a CPS+EG (Clinical stage/PathologicalStage +ER status/nuclearGrade) score of 3 or higher.[101] The primary study end point was invasive disease-free survival (IDFS).[100][Level of evidence B1] At the time of the first (and only) planned interim analysis, when 284 events (i.e., invasive disease or death) had occurred, the HR for IDFS strongly favored the olaparib arm, and the prespecified stopping boundary for significance was exceeded (3-year IDFS rate, 85.9% vs 77.1%; HR, 0.58; 99.5% CI, 0.41–0.82;P< .001).[100][Level of evidence B1] Distant DFS was also statistically significantly improved for patients who received olaparib (HR, 0.57; 99.5% CI, 0.39–0.83;P< .001).
