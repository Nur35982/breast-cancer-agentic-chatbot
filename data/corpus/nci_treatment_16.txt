The 10-year distant recurrence risk for patients treated with tamoxifen was 7% for those with a low recurrence score (defined in this trial as <18), 14% for those with an intermediate recurrence score (defined in this trial as 18–30), and 31% for those with high recurrence score (defined in this trial as ≥31) (P< .001).[73] A community-based, case-control study examined the prognostic ability of the recurrence score to predict breast cancer deaths after 10 years in a group of tamoxifen-treated patients and observed a similar prognostic pattern to that seen in patients from NSABP B-14.[74] The use of Oncotype Dx to predict benefit from chemotherapy in patients with node-negative, ER-positive breast cancer was initially assessed in a prospective-retrospective way using the tamoxifen alone (n = 227) and the combination arms (n = 424) of theNSABP B-20trial.[72] Patients in the NSABP B-20 trial were randomly assigned to receive tamoxifen alone or tamoxifen concurrently with methotrexate and fluorouracil (MF) or cyclophosphamide with MF.[75]The 10-year distant disease-free survival (DFS) improved from 60% to 88% by adding chemotherapy to tamoxifen in the high-risk group (defined in this trial as ≥31), while no benefit was observed in the low recurrence score group.[76] The 10-year distant disease-free survival (DFS) improved from 60% to 88% by adding chemotherapy to tamoxifen in the high-risk group (defined in this trial as ≥31), while no benefit was observed in the low recurrence score group.[76] Similar findings were reported in the prospective-retrospective evaluation of theSWOG-8814trial (NCT00929591) in hormone receptor–positive, lymph node–positive, postmenopausal patients treated with tamoxifen with or without cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fluorouracil.[77] However, the sample size in this analysis was small, follow-up was only 5 years, and the prognostic impact of having positive nodes needs to be taken into consideration.Of note, both analyses (NSABP B-20 and S8814) were underpowered for any conclusive predictive analysis among patients identified as having an intermediate recurrence score.
