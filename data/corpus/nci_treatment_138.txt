No differences in DFS, distant DFS, and OS were observed between these two arms.
The International Breast Cancer Study Group trials VI and VII also varied the timing of radiation therapy with CMF adjuvant chemotherapy and reported results similar to NSABP-B-15.[29] These studies showed that delaying radiation therapy for 2 to 7 months after surgery had no effect on the rate of local recurrence.
These findings have been confirmed in a meta-analysis.[30][Level of evidence A1] In an unplanned analysis of patients treated on a phase III trial evaluating the benefit of adding trastuzumab in HER2-positive breast cancer patients, there was no associated increase in acute adverse events or frequency of cardiac events in patients who received concurrent adjuvant radiation therapy and trastuzumab.[31] Therefore, delivering radiation therapy concomitantly with trastuzumab appears to be safe and avoids additional delay in radiation therapy treatment initiation.
