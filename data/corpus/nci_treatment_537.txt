Similarly, no difference in survival was noted when patients with partial response or stable disease after initial therapy were randomly assigned to receive either a different chemotherapy versus observation [129] or a different chemotherapy regimen given at higher versus lower doses.[130][Level of evidence A1] However, 324 patients who achieved disease control were randomly assigned to maintenance chemotherapy or observation.
Patients who received maintenance chemotherapy (paclitaxel and gemcitabine) had improved PFS at 6 months and improved OS.
This was associated with an increased rate of adverse events.[131][Level of evidence A1] Because there is no standard approach for treating metastatic disease, patients requiring second-line regimens are good candidates for clinical trials.
