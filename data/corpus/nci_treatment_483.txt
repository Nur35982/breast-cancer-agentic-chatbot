The median OS was 22.1 months for patients who received atezolizumab and paclitaxel compared with 28.3 months for patients who received placebo and paclitaxel in the PD-L1–positive population (HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 0.76–1.64).Results in the ITT population were consistent with the PD-L1–positive population.
The safety profile was consistent with known effects of each study drug.
The final OS results showed no difference between the treatment arms.
