All patients with metastatic breast cancer are considered candidates for ongoing clinical trials.
CDK4 and CDK6 have been implicated in the continued proliferation of hormone receptor–positive breast cancer resistant to endocrine therapy.
CDK inhibitors have been approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in combination with endocrine therapy in both first-line and later-line treatment of advanced, HER2-negative hormone receptor–positive breast cancer.
Three oral CDK4/6 inhibitors are currently available: palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib.
Overall, the addition of CDK4/6 inhibitors to endocrine therapy is associated with improved breast cancer outcomes and, in general, either maintained or improved quality of life.[3-8] This benefit was observed across multiple clinicopathological subgroups of breast cancer.[9] Evidence (first-line palbociclib and endocrine therapy): PALOMA-2(NCT01740427) confirmed the results of the phase II PALOMA-1 trial.[10] This phase III, double-blind trial compared placebo plus letrozole with palbociclib plus letrozole as initial therapy for ER-positive postmenopausal patients with advanced disease (n = 666).
