These results were confirmed in a landmark analysis that excluded patients who experienced a DFS event or who were lost to follow-up before treatment divergence (2–3 years after randomization).
The 12-year OS rate was 84% in the control group and 88% in the extended-therapy group (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.60–0.98;P= .036).[86][Level of evidence A1] Grade 3 or greater arthralgia and myalgia were slightly more frequent in the extended-therapy group than in the control group (3.0% vs.
2.2% and 0.9% vs.
0.7%, respectively).
The phase III ABCSG-16 study enrolled 3,484 postmenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer who had completed 5 years of endocrine therapy with tamoxifen and/or an AI to either 2 or 5 years of extended therapy with anastrozole.
