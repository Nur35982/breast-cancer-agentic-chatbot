Both groups received investigator's choice of chemotherapy (capecitabine, eribulin, gemcitabine, or vinorelbine).
Eligible patients had disease progression after two or more previous anti-HER2 therapies and one to three lines of therapy for metastatic disease.
All patients had received previous trastuzumab, all but one had received previous pertuzumab, and 91.2% had received prior ado-trastuzumab emtansine.
The sequential primary end points were PFS by central review followed by OS.[80,81][Level of evidence B1]Margetuximab improved primary PFS over trastuzumab with a 24% relative risk reduction (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59â€“0.98;P= .03) (median PFS, 5.8 months vs.
