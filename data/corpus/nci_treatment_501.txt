15.8 months; HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54–0.85;P= .0007).[77] At a median follow-up of 7.2 months in the T-DM1 group and 6.5 months in the physician’s-choice group, median PFS was 6.2 months in the T-DM1 group and 3.3 months in the physician’s-choice group (HR, 0.528; 95% CI, 0.422–0.661;P< .0001).
OS was significantly longer with trastuzumab emtansine versus the treatment of physician’s choice (median OS, 22.7 months vs.
15.8 months; HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.54–0.85;P= .0007).[77] The role of T-DM1 as first-line treatment of metastatic HER2-overexpressed breast cancer was evaluated in the phase IIIMARIANNEtrial (NCT01120184).[78][Level of evidence B1] This study randomly assigned 1,095 patients to receive either trastuzumab plus taxane, T-DM1 plus placebo, or T-DM1 plus pertuzumab.The median PFS for these treatment groups was 13.7 months for the trastuzumab-plus-taxane group, 14.1 months for the T-DM1-plus-placebo group, and 15.2 months for the T-DM1-plus-pertuzumab group.There was no significant difference in PFS with T-DM1 plus placebo compared with trastuzumab plus taxane (HR, 0.91; 97.5% CI, 0.73–1.13), or with T-DM1 plus pertuzumab compared with trastuzumab plus taxane (HR, 0.87; 97.5% CI, 0.69–1.08).Therefore, neither T-DM1 plus placebo nor T-DM1 plus pertuzumab showed PFS superiority over trastuzumab plus taxane.
