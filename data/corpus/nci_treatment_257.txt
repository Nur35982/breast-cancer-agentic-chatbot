Compared with denosumab, the amount of evidence supporting bisphosphonates is greater, and there is evidence supporting a reduction in breast cancer mortality—an end point that is more clinically relevant.
The optimal duration of bisphosphonate therapy is uncertain.
Evidence (bisphosphonates in the treatment of early breast cancer): A meta-analysis included data from 18,766 patients from 26 adjuvant trials of bisphosphonates of any type.[95] Overall, reductions associated with bisphosphonate use in recurrence (RR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.87–1.01; 2-sidedP= .08), distant recurrence (RR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.85–0.99; 2-sidedP= .03), and breast cancer mortality (RR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.83–0.99; 2-sidedP= .04) were of only borderline significance, but the reduction in bone recurrence was more definite (RR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.73–0.94; 2-sidedP= .004).In a prespecified subgroup analysis among premenopausal women, treatment had no apparent effect on any outcome, but among 11,767 postmenopausal women, it produced highly significant reductions in recurrence (RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.78–0.94; 2-sidedP= .002), distant recurrence (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.74–0.92; 2-sidedP= .0003), bone recurrence (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.60–0.86; 2-sidedP= .0002), and breast cancer mortality (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.73–0.93; 2-sidedP= .002).[95] In a prespecified subgroup analysis among premenopausal women, treatment had no apparent effect on any outcome, but among 11,767 postmenopausal women, it produced highly significant reductions in recurrence (RR, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.78–0.94; 2-sidedP= .002), distant recurrence (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.74–0.92; 2-sidedP= .0003), bone recurrence (RR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.60–0.86; 2-sidedP= .0002), and breast cancer mortality (RR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.73–0.93; 2-sidedP= .002).[95] TheABCSG-18trial (NCT00556374) included 3,435 postmenopausal women with receptor-positive breast cancer who were receiving an AI.
