Additionally, initiating chemotherapy soon after breast-conserving surgery may be preferable for patients at high risk of distant dissemination.
Evidence (timing of postoperative radiation therapy): In a randomized trial, patients received one of the following regimens:[27][Level of evidence A1]Chemotherapy first (n = 122), consisting of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, fluorouracil (5-FU), and prednisone plus doxorubicin repeated every 21 days for four cycles, followed by breast radiation.Breast radiation first (n = 122), followed by the same chemotherapy.The following results were observed:With a median follow-up of 5 years, OS was 73% for the radiation-first group and 81% for the chemotherapy-first group (P= .11).The 5-year crude rate of first recurrence by site was 5% in the radiation-first group and 14% in the chemotherapy-first group for local recurrence and 32% in the radiation-first group and 20% in the chemotherapy-first group for distant or regional recurrence or both.
