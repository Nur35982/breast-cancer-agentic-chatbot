Compared with 5 years, 10 years of tamoxifen therapy increased the risk of the following:Pulmonary embolus: RR, 1.87 (95% CI, 1.13–3.07;P= .01).Stroke: RR, 1.06 (95% CI, 0.83–1.36).Ischemic heart disease: RR, 0.76 (95% CI, 0.6–0.95;P= .02).Endometrial cancer: RR, 1.74 (95% CI, 1.30–2.34;P= .0002).
Notably, the cumulative risk of endometrial cancer during years 5 to 14 from breast cancer diagnosis was 3.1% for women who received 10 years of tamoxifen versus 1.6% for women who received 5 years of tamoxifen.
The mortality for years 5 to 14 was 12.2 versus 15 for an absolute mortality reduction of 2.8%.
