20.3 months,P= .05).[66][Level of evidence A1] Patients treated with chemotherapy plus trastuzumab had an OS advantage over those who received chemotherapy alone (25.1 months vs.
20.3 months,P= .05).[66][Level of evidence A1] Notably, when combined with doxorubicin, trastuzumab is associated with significant cardiac toxicity.[67] Clinical trials comparing multiagent chemotherapy plus trastuzumab with single-agent chemotherapy have yielded conflicting results.
In one randomized study of patients with metastatic breast cancer treated with trastuzumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin, patients tolerated the combination well and had a longer time to disease progression, compared with those treated with trastuzumab and paclitaxel alone.[68][Level of evidence B1] However, no difference in OS, time to disease progression, or response rate was shown in the Breast Cancer International Research Groupâ€™s phase III trial (BCIRG-007[NCT00047255]) that compared carboplatin and docetaxel plus trastuzumab versus docetaxel plus trastuzumab as first-line chemotherapy for metastatic HER2-overexpressing breast cancer.[69][Level of evidence A1] Outside of a clinical trial, standard first-line treatment for metastatic HER2-overexpressing breast cancer is single-agent chemotherapy plus trastuzumab.
