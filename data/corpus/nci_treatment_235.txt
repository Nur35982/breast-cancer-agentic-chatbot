An intent-to-treat analysis of the primary study end point, DFS, demonstrated a nonsignificant benefit of exemestane (HR, 0.68;P= .07).
The optimal duration of AI therapy is uncertain, and multiple trials have evaluated courses longer than 5 years.
Evidence regarding extension of endocrine therapy beyond 5 years of initial AI-based adjuvant therapy: A double-blind, randomized, phase III trial assessed the effect of an additional 5 years of letrozole versus placebo in 1,918 women who had received 5 years of an AI.[81] Patients who received previous tamoxifen therapy were included.
Most women on the study (70.6%) had received 4.5 to 6 years of adjuvant tamoxifen, but a significant proportion of them (20.7%) had been treated initially with an AI.
