Follow-up results at 8 years, however, did not demonstrate heterogeneity of treatment effect according to whether chemotherapy was administered, although recurrences were more frequent among patients who received chemotherapy.[54] Upon initial report, with a median follow-up of 5.6 years, there was no significant difference in the primary outcome of DFS (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.66–1.04;P= .10); the 5-year DFS rate was 86% in the tamoxifen-plus-ovarian-suppression group versus 84.7% in the tamoxifen-alone group.
However, updated results with a median follow-up of 8 years, demonstrated improved DFS with tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression compared with tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.62–0.93;P= .009); the 8-year DFS rate was 83.2% in the tamoxifen-plus-ovarian-suppression group versus 78.9% in the tamoxifen-alone group.
