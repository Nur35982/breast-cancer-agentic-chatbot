These results were confirmed in a landmark analysis that excluded patients who experienced a DFS event or who were lost to follow-up before treatment divergence (2–3 years after randomization).The 12-year OS rate was 84% in the control group and 88% in the extended-therapy group (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.60–0.98;P= .036).[86][Level of evidence A1]Grade 3 or greater arthralgia and myalgia were slightly more frequent in the extended-therapy group than in the control group (3.0% vs.
2.2% and 0.9% vs.
0.7%, respectively).
After 11.7 years of follow-up, the 12-year DFS rate was 62% in the control group and 67% in the extended-therapy group (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.65–0.93;P= .0064).
