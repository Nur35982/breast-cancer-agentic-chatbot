Grade 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia were more common in the anthracycline arm (23 patients [10%]) than in the non-anthracycline arm (3 patients [1%],P< .0001).
Patients who have not been treated with preoperative systemic therapy.
Standard treatment for HER2-positive early breast cancer is 1 year of adjuvant HER2-targeted therapy.
Several phase III clinical trials have addressed the role of the anti-HER2 antibody, trastuzumab, as adjuvant therapy for patients with HER2-overexpressing cancers.
Study results confirm the benefit of 1 year of adjuvant trastuzumab therapy.
Evidence (including duration of trastuzumab therapy for patients who have not been treated with preoperative systemic therapy): The Herceptin Adjuvant (HERA) (BIG-01-01[NCT00045032]) trial examined the efficacy of trastuzumab as adjuvant treatment for HER2-positive breast cancer if used after completion of the primary treatment.
