The results did not meet the prespecified criterion for equivalence, an HR of 1.50 or less.Toxicity was not substantially different between the arms.[16][Level of evidence B1] At a median follow-up of 10.2 years (interquartile range, 7.5–11.5), 90 of 2,089 women (4%) eligible for the primary outcome in the APBI group and 71 of 2,036 women (3%) in the whole-breast radiation therapy group had an ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (HR, 1.22; 90% CI, 0.94–1.58).

Toxicity was not substantially different between the arms.[16][Level of evidence B1] The randomized, phase III, single-centerAPBI-IMRT-Florencetrial (NCT02104895) evaluated differences in ipsilateral breast tumor recurrence (IBTR) among patients who received APBI using either intensity-modulated radiation therapy, an advanced radiation technique, (30 Gy in five once-daily fractions) or whole-breast radiation therapy with tangents (50 Gy in 25 fractions with a tumor bed boost).
