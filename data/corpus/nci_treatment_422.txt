The MONALEESA-3 trial included patients receiving second-line therapy.

Evidence: TheMONARCH 2study (NCT02107703) tested abemaciclib (CDK4/6 inhibitor) in a phase III, placebo-controlled trial that randomly assigned 669 patients with HER2-negative, hormone receptor–positive, advanced breast cancer (with previous progression on endocrine therapy) to receive abemaciclib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant.[23]The primary end point (investigator-assessed PFS) was met, with median duration of follow-up of 19.5 months.
