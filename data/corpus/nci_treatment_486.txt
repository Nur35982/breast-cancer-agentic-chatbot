The primary end point was PFS.
All patients had previous taxane exposure.
Patients received sacituzumab govitecan at a dose of 10 mg/kg intravenously on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle.[62]In the chemotherapy arm, 54% of patients received eribulin, 20% received vinorelbine, 13% received capecitabine, and 12% received gemcitabine.The median PFS was 5.6 months (95% CI, 4.3–6.3; 166 events) in the sacituzumab govitecan arm and 1.7 months (95% CI, 1.5–2.6; 150 events) in the chemotherapy arm (HRdisease progression or death, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.32–0.52;P< .001).[62][Level of evidence A1]The median OS was 12.1 months (95% CI, 10.7–14.0) in the sacituzumab govitecan arm and 6.7 months (95% CI, 5.8–7.7) in the chemotherapy arm (HRdeath, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.38–0.59;P< .001).The overall response rate was 35% in the sacituzumab govitecan arm and 5% in the chemotherapy arm.Key treatment-related adverse events of grade 3 or higher occurred more often in patients who received sacituzumab govitecan than patients who received chemotherapy: neutropenia (51% vs.
