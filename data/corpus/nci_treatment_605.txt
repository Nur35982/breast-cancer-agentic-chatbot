It was used to retrospectively analyze 333 patients treated with either excision alone or excision and radiation therapy.[18] Using this prognostic index, patients with favorable lesions who received surgical excision alone had a low recurrence rate (i.e., 2%, with a median follow-up of 79 months).
A subsequent analysis of these data was performed to determine the influence of margin width on local control.[19] Patients whose excised lesions had margin widths of 10 mm or more in every direction had an extremely low probability of local recurrence with surgery alone (4%, with a mean follow-up of 8 years).
