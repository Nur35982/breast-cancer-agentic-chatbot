The SOUND trial randomly assigned 1,493 women with invasive breast cancer to undergo SLN biopsy or no axillary surgery.
Patients were of any age, had tumors smaller than 2 cm, had negative preoperative axillary ultrasonography, and planned to receive breast-conserving surgery and adjuvant radiation therapy (cited Gentilini et al.
as reference 34 and level of evidence A1).
The INSEMA trial randomly assigned 5,502 women with clinically node-negative invasive breast cancer to undergo no axillary surgery or SLN biopsy.
Tumors had to be smaller than 5 cm, and most patients had T1 disease and estrogen receptorâ€“positive tumors.
