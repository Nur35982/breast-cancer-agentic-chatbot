In addition, the proportional reductions in both recurrence and mortality associated with tamoxifen use were similar in women with either node-negative or node-positive breast cancer, but the absolute improvement in survival at 10 years was greater in the node-positive breast cancer group (5.3% vs.
12.5% with 5 years of use).
Similar results were found in the IBCSG-13-93 trial.[39] Of 1,246 women with stage II disease, only the women with hormone receptorâ€“positive disease benefited from tamoxifen.
The optimal duration of tamoxifen use has been addressed by the EBCTCG meta-analysis and by several large randomized trials.[21,40-43] Ten years of tamoxifen therapy has shown superiority to shorter durations of tamoxifen therapy.
