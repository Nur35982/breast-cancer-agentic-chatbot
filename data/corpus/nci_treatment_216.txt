89.7%; HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.66–0.96;P= .02).
Despite improvements in DFS and freedom from distant recurrence, no difference in OS was observed in the exemestane-ovarian suppression group compared with the tamoxifen-ovarian suppression group (93.4% vs.
93.3%; HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.79–1.22;P= .84).[57][Level of evidence A1] However, after a median follow-up of 12 years in the SOFT trial, the 12-year OS rate was 89.4% in the exemestane-ovarian suppression group and 86.8% in a tamoxifen-alone group from that study (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.62–1.04).[58] A follow-up report on the differences in quality of life (QOL) for the exemestane-ovarian suppression group versus the tamoxifen-ovarian suppression group observed the following results (the differences cited below were all significant atP< .001 and occurred in patients who did and did not receive chemotherapy):[59]Patients who received tamoxifen plus ovarian function suppression were more affected by hot flashes and sweats over 5 years than were those who received exemestane plus ovarian function suppression, although these symptoms improved.Patients who received exemestane plus ovarian function suppression reported more vaginal dryness, greater loss of sexual interest, and more difficulties becoming aroused than did patients who received tamoxifen plus ovarian function suppression.
