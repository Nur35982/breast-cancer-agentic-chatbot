397 deaths for 5 years of tamoxifen;P= .01), and reduced overall mortality (639 deaths for 10 years of tamoxifen vs.
722 deaths for 5 years of tamoxifen;P= .01).Of note, from the time of the original breast cancer diagnosis, the benefits of 10 years of therapy were less extreme before than after year 10.
At 15 years from the time of diagnosis, breast cancer mortality was 15% at 10 years and 12.2% at 5 years.Compared with 5 years, 10 years of tamoxifen therapy increased the risk of the following:Pulmonary embolus: RR, 1.87 (95% CI, 1.13–3.07;P= .01).Stroke: RR, 1.06 (95% CI, 0.83–1.36).Ischemic heart disease: RR, 0.76 (95% CI, 0.6–0.95;P= .02).Endometrial cancer: RR, 1.74 (95% CI, 1.30–2.34;P= .0002).
