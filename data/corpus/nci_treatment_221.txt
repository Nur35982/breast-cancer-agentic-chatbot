In an analysis conducted after a median follow-up of 100 months among hormone receptor–positive patients, DFS was significantly (P= .003) longer in patients on anastrozole (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.76–0.94), but OS was not improved (HR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.86–1.11;P= .7).[62] Patients on tamoxifen more frequently developed endometrial cancer and cerebrovascular accidents, whereas patients on anastrozole had more fracture episodes.
The frequency of myocardial infarction was similar in both groups.
Except for a continued increased frequency of endometrial cancer in the tamoxifen group, these differences did not persist in the posttreatment period.[62] A large, double-blind, randomized trial of 8,010 postmenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer compared the use of letrozole with tamoxifen given continuously for 5 years or with crossover to the alternate drug at 2 years.[63] An updated analysis from the International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBCSG-1-98[NCT00004205]) reported results on the 4,922 women who received tamoxifen or letrozole for 5 years at a median follow-up of 51 months.[64][Level of evidence B1]DFS was significantly superior in patients treated with letrozole (HR, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.71–0.95;P= .007; 5-year DFS, 84.0% vs.
