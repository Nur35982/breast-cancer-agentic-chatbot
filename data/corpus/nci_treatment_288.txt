Patients received adjuvant trastuzumab to complete 1 year of therapy.[119][Level of evidence B1] The pCR rates between the arms differed by 4.7% (95% CI, 4.0%–13.4%); 40.7% in the IV-administered group versus 45.4% in the SQ-administered group, demonstrating noninferiority for the SQ formulation.
EFS and OS were secondary end points.
The 6-year EFS rate was 65% in both arms (HR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.74−1.29).
The 6-year OS rate was 84% in both arms (HR, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.61−1.45).[120] Newer HER2-targeted therapies (lapatinib, pertuzumab) have also been investigated.
It appears that dual targeting of the HER2 receptor results in an increase in pCR rate.
