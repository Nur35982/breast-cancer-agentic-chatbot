The study found the overall average mean dose to the whole heart was 4.9 Gy (range, 0.03–27.72).
The rates of major coronary events increased linearly with the mean dose to the heart by 7.4% per Gy (95% CI, 2.9%–14.5%;P< .001), with no apparent threshold.[41] Arm lymphedema.Lymphedema remains a major quality-of-life concern for breast cancer patients.
Single-modality treatment of the axilla (surgery or radiation) is associated with a low incidence of arm edema.
In patients who receive axillary dissection, adjuvant radiation therapy increases the risk of arm edema.
Edema occurs in 2% to 10% of patients who receive axillary dissection alone compared with 13% to 18% of patients who receive axillary dissection and adjuvant radiation therapy.[42-44] For more information, seeLymphedema.
