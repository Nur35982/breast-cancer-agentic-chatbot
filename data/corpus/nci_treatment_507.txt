Compared with trastuzumab, margetuximab was designed to increase binding affinity (in vitro) for the activating Fc-gamma receptor and decrease binding affinity for the inhibitory Fc-gamma receptor.
Evidence (margetuximab): The primary PFS analysis from the phase IIISOPHIAstudy (NCT02492711) led to the FDA approval of margetuximab with chemotherapy in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who have received as least two previous anti-HER2 regimens, at least one of which was for metastatic disease.
The open-label SOPHIA trial randomly assigned 536 patients in the ITT population to receive either margetuximab or trastuzumab.
