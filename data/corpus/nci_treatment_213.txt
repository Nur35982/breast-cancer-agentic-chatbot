At a median follow-up of 62 months, there was no difference in DFS (HR, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.81–1.44;P= .59).
OS was superior with tamoxifen (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.08–2.83;P= .02).
In two unblinded studies that were analyzed together (TEXT[NCT00066703] andSOFT[NCT00066690]), exemestane was also compared with tamoxifen in 4,690 premenopausal women who underwent ovarian ablation.[57]The use of exemestane resulted in a significant difference in DFS.
The 8-year DFS rate was 86.8% in the exemestane-ovarian suppression group vs.
82.8% in the tamoxifen-ovarian suppression group (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.67–0.90;P< .001).[57][Level of evidence B1]The 8-year rate of freedom from distant recurrence was also higher in the exemestane-ovarian suppression group (91.8% vs.
