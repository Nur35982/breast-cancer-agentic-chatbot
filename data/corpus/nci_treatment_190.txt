Exploratory analyses suggested the greatest benefits from the TaxAC regimens were seen in patients with triple-negative disease and hormone receptor–positive disease with involved axillary lymph nodes, supporting a role for non–anthracycline-containing regimens in patients with lower-risk disease.
In an interim futility analysis, the HR for IDFS was 1.202 (95% CI, 0.97–1.49) for TC versus TaxAC, which exceeded the predetermined limit to define TC as inferior.
The 4-year IDFS rate was 88.2% for patients who received TC and 90.7% for patients who received TaxAC (P= .04).
Although the findings favored treatment with regimens containing an anthracycline/cyclophosphamide plus a taxane, absolute differences between TC and TaxAC were small.
