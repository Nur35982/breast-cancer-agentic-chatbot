On multivariable analysis, only radiation therapy (HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.19–0.64;P= .0007) and tamoxifen use (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.25–0.78;P= .0047) were associated with reduced in-breast recurrence.[13] The results of the NSABP-B-17 and EORTC-10853 trials plus two others were included in a meta-analysis that demonstrated reductions in all ipsilateral breast events (HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.41–0.58;P< .00001), ipsilateral invasive recurrence (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.32–0.76;P= .001), and ipsilateral DCIS recurrence (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.39–0.95;P= .03).[14][Level of evidence B1] However, after 10 years of follow-up, there was no significant effect on breast cancer mortality, mortality from causes other than breast cancer, or all-cause mortality.[11] To identify a favorable group of patients for whom postoperative radiation therapy could be omitted, several pathological staging systems have been developed and tested retrospectively, but consensus recommendations have not been achieved.[15-18] The Van Nuys Prognostic Index is one pathological staging system that combines three predictors of local recurrence (i.e., tumor size, margin width, and pathological classification).
