When breast cancer is suspected, patient management generally includes: Confirmation of the diagnosis.
Evaluation of the stage of disease.
Selection of therapy.
The following tests and procedures are used to diagnose breast cancer: Mammography.
Ultrasonography.
Breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), if clinically indicated.
Biopsy.
Pathologically, breast cancer can be a multicentric and bilateral disease.
Synchronous bilateral disease is somewhat more common in patients with infiltrating lobular carcinoma.
At 10 years after diagnosis, the risk of a primary breast cancer in the contralateral breast ranges from 3% to 5%, although endocrine therapy decreases that risk.[50-53] The development of a contralateral breast cancer is associated with an increased risk of distant recurrence.[54] When patients withBRCA1orBRCA2pathogenic variants were diagnosed before age 40 years, the risk of a contralateral breast cancer reached nearly 50% in the ensuing 25 years.[55,56] Patients who have breast cancer will undergo bilateral mammography at the time of diagnosis to rule out synchronous disease.
