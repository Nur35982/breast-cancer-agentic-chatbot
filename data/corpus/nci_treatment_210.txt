In addition, OS at 8 years was improved with tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression compared with tamoxifen alone (HR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.48â€“0.92;P= .01); the 8-year OS rate was 93.3% in the tamoxifen-plus-ovarian-suppression group versus 91.5% in the tamoxifen-alone group.Despite overall negative initial results, subgroup analysis suggested a benefit with ovarian suppression in women who underwent chemotherapy and remained premenopausal afterwards.
Follow-up results at 8 years, however, did not demonstrate heterogeneity of treatment effect according to whether chemotherapy was administered, although recurrences were more frequent among patients who received chemotherapy.[54] Despite overall negative initial results, subgroup analysis suggested a benefit with ovarian suppression in women who underwent chemotherapy and remained premenopausal afterwards.
