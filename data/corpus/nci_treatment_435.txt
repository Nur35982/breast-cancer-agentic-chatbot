Toxicities were greater on the everolimus arm and similar to those in the BOLERO2 trial.
In an exploratory analysis, OS was 32.9 months in the tamoxifen group and not reached in the combination group (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24−0.81;P= .007).[29][Level of evidence A1] PrE0102(NCT01797120) was a double-blind, randomized, phase II trial comparing fulvestrant with fulvestrant plus everolimus in postmenopausal women whose disease had progressed after receiving an AI in the adjuvant or metastatic setting.
Sixty-six women were randomly assigned to the combination arm and 65 to fulvestrant alone.[30]Median PFS was 10.3 months on the combination arm and 5.1 months on the fulvestrant-alone arm (HR, 0.61; 95% CI, 0.40−0.92;P= .02).[30][Level of evidence B1]Toxicities were similar to those in previous studies.The was no observed difference in OS between the arms.
