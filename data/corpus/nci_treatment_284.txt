The unadjusted HR for EFS between the two randomized HER2-positive treatment groups was 0.64 (95% CI, 0.44â€“0.93; two-sided log-rankP= .016).
EFS was strongly associated with pCR in patients who received trastuzumab.[115] Symptomatic cardiac failure occurred in two patients who received concurrent doxorubicin and trastuzumab for two cycles.
Close cardiac monitoring of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and the total dose of doxorubicin not exceeding 180 mg/m2accounted for the relatively low number of declines in LVEF and only two cardiac events.
