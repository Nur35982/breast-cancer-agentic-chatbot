Patients who received an AI as either their first or second hormone therapy for metastatic disease and were randomly assigned to receive a third-generation drug (anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane, or vorozole) lived longer (HRdeath, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.82–0.93) than those who received standard therapy (tamoxifen or a progestational agent).
Fulvestrant is a selective estrogen receptor degrader that has been studied in the first-line and second-line setting in women with advanced or metastatic breast cancer.
Evidence (first-line fulvestrant): FALCON(NCT01602380) was a phase III, double-blind, randomized trial that compared fulvestrant (500 mg) with anastrozole (1 mg) in patients with advanced or metastatic receptor-positive breast cancer who had not received previous endocrine therapy.[41] The trial randomly assigned 230 patients to receive fulvestrant and 232 patients to receive anastrozole.Median PFS was 16.6 months in the fulvestrant group and 13.8 months in the anastrozole group (HR, 0.797; 95% CI, 0.637−0.999;P= .049).[41][Level of evidence B1]The frequency of adverse events was similar in the two groups, and there was no difference in quality of life.OS results were not reported.
