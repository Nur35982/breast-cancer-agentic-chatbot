For patients who undergo surgery first, combination chemotherapy is typically given in the adjuvant setting.
While there is no established standard therapy in this setting, the following trial provides evidence that a non–anthracycline-based regimen may be suitable: Evidence (adjuvant non–anthracycline-containing regimens): ThePATTERNtrial (NCT01216111) compared an anthracycline-based regimen (cyclophosphamide, 5-FU, epirubicin, and docetaxel [CEF-T]) with paclitaxel and carboplatin (PCb) in 647 Chinese women with TNBC who had completed definitive surgery.
