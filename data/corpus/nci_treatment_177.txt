The pCR rate was higher in the nab-paclitaxel arm (233 patients, 38%; 95% CI, 35%–42%) when compared with the paclitaxel arm (174 patients, 29%; 95% CI, 25%–33%).[15][Level of evidence B3] However, in theETNAtrial (NCT01822314) that compared neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel with paclitaxel followed by anthracycline-based therapy, no significant difference in pCR was observed, and neutropenia and peripheral neuropathy were more frequent in the nab-paclitaxel arm.[16] Differences in taxane dose and schedule may explain the different findings in the GeparSepto and ETNA trials.
The incorporation of other cytotoxic agents to anthracycline/taxane–based regimens has not offered a significant additional benefit to breast conservation or pCR rate in unselected breast cancer populations.[17][Level of evidence B3] Preoperative endocrine therapy may be an option for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor–positive breast cancer when chemotherapy is not a suitable option because of comorbidities or performance status.
