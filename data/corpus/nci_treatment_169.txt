Multidisciplinary management of patients undergoing preoperative therapy by an experienced team is essential to optimize the following: Patient selection.
Choice of systemic therapy.
Management of the axilla and surgical approach.
Decision to administer adjuvant radiation therapy.
The tumor histology, grade, and hormone receptor status are carefully evaluated before preoperative therapy is initiated.
Patients whose tumors have a pure lobular histology, low grade, or high hormone receptor expression and HER2-negative status are less likely to respond to chemotherapy and should consider primary surgery, especially if the nodes are clinically negative.
