The study found the overall average mean dose to the whole heart was 4.9 Gy (range, 0.03–27.72).
The rates of major coronary events increased linearly with the mean dose to the heart by 7.4% per Gy (95% CI, 2.9%–14.5%;P< .001), with no apparent threshold.[41] Modern radiation therapy techniques introduced in the 1990s minimized deep radiation to the underlying myocardium when left-sided chest wall or left-breast radiation was used.
Cardiac mortality decreased accordingly.[37,38] An analysis of the National Cancer Institute’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) data from 1973 to 1989 that reviewed deaths caused by ischemic heart disease in women who received breast or chest wall radiation showed that since 1980, no increased death rate resulting from ischemic heart disease in women who received left chest wall or breast radiation was found.[39,40][Level of evidence C1] A population-based case-control study evaluated major coronary events (i.e., myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or death from ischemic heart disease) in 2,168 women who underwent radiation therapy for breast cancer.
