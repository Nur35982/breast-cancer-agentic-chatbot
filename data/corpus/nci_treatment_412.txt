Grade 3 to 4 neutropenia occurred in 53.4% of patients in the ribociclib group and 0.0% of patients in the placebo group.
The rate of febrile neutropenia was 1.0% in the ribociclib group and 0% in the placebo group.
An increase in QTcF interval of more than 60 milliseconds from baseline was observed in 6.5% of patients in the ribociclib arm and 0.4% in the placebo arm.
Ribociclib was also assessed in the first-line setting in a study conducted solely in premenopausal or perimenopausal women receiving either tamoxifen or a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (AI) plus goserelin.[17] In theMONALEESA-7trial (NCT02278120), 672 premenopausal patients with HER2-negative hormone receptorâ€“positive, recurrent or metastatic breast cancer, who had not received endocrine therapy for advanced disease, were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to ribociclib or placebo.The primary end point (investigator-assessed PFS) was met.
