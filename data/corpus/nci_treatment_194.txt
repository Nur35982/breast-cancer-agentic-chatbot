Because of the weaknesses and limitations of this study design, the optimal time to initiate adjuvant chemotherapy remains uncertain.
A population-based study from California included 24,843 patients and found that delays in initiating adjuvant chemotherapy of 90 days or less had no impact on OS, but found a substantial effect for delays over 90 days (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.05–1.53), particularly among patients with TNBC.[36][Level of evidence C1] Multiple other studies have examined the effect of treatment delays of 90 days or less and have reported inconsistent results, with the possible exception of patients with TNBC.[36] Much of the evidence presented in the following sections on therapy for women with hormone receptor–positive disease has been considered in an American Society of Clinical Oncology guideline that describes several options for the management of these patients.[37] Five years of adjuvant endocrine therapy has been shown to substantially reduce the risks of locoregional and distant recurrence, contralateral breast cancer, and death from breast cancer.
