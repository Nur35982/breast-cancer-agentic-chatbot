Patients with good-risk DCIS (defined as mammographically detected low- or intermediate-grade DCIS, measuring <2.5 cm with margins of ≥3 mm) were enrolled.[12]The 15-year cumulative incidence of in-breast recurrence was 7.1% (95% CI, 4.0%–11.5%) with radiation therapy versus 15.1% (95% CI, 10.8%–20.2%) with observation (HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.20–0.66;P= .0007).
On multivariable analysis, only radiation therapy (HR, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.19–0.64;P= .0007) and tamoxifen use (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.25–0.78;P= .0047) were associated with reduced in-breast recurrence.[13] The 15-year cumulative incidence of in-breast recurrence was 7.1% (95% CI, 4.0%–11.5%) with radiation therapy versus 15.1% (95% CI, 10.8%–20.2%) with observation (HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.20–0.66;P= .0007).
