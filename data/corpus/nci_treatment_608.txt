Women in the tamoxifen group had fewer breast cancer events at 5 years than did those treated with a placebo (8.2% vs.
13.4%;P= .009).[21][Level of evidence B1] With tamoxifen, ipsilateral invasive breast cancer decreased from 4.2% to 2.1% at 5 years (P= .03).
Tamoxifen also decreased the incidence of contralateral breast neoplasms (invasive and noninvasive) from 0.8% per year to 0.4% per year (P= .01).
The benefit of tamoxifen extended to patients with positive or uncertain margins.[22] For more information, seeBreast Cancer Prevention.
No survival advantage was demonstrated for the use of tamoxifen.
