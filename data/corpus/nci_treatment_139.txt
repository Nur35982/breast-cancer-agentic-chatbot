Acute toxicities of radiation therapy include radiation dermatitis, breast swelling and/or itching, tightness in the axillary area, and fatigue.
If regional nodes are being treated, patients can also experience nausea and a sore throat due to radiation esophagitis.
Symptoms typically peak 1 to 2 weeks after radiation therapy, then decrease slowly over the next 4 to 6 weeks.[32] Late toxicities of radiation therapy are uncommon and can be minimized with radiation delivery techniques and with careful delineation of the target volume.
Late effects of radiation include: Radiation pneumonitis.In a retrospective analysis of 1,624 women treated with conservative surgery and adjuvant breast radiation at a single institution, the overall incidence of symptomatic radiation pneumonitis was 1.0% at a median follow-up of 77 months.[33] The incidence of pneumonitis increased to 3.0% with the use of a supraclavicular radiation field and to 8.8% when concurrent chemotherapy was administered.
