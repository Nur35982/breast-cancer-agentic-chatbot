Further, an analysis of National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) trials showed that even in patients with large (>5 cm) primary tumors and negative axillary lymph nodes, the risk of isolated locoregional recurrence was low enough (7.1%) that routine locoregional radiation therapy was not warranted.[26] The optimal sequence of adjuvant chemotherapy and radiation therapy after breast-conserving surgery has been studied.
Based on studies, delaying radiation therapy for several months after breast-conserving surgery until the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy does not appear to have a negative impact on overall outcome.
