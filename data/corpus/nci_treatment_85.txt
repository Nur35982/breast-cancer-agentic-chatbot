Women were randomly assigned to undergo ALND or no further axillary treatment.
Patients had clinical T1 or T2 invasive breast cancer without palpable adenopathy and one to two SLNs containing metastases identified by frozen section.
All patients underwent lumpectomy, tangential whole-breast radiation therapy, and appropriate systemic therapy.
OS was the primary end point, and DFS was the secondary end point.
Because of enrollment challenges, a total of 891 women out of a target enrollment of 1,900 women were randomly assigned to one of the two treatment arms.[Level of evidence A1]At a median follow-up of 6.3 years, the 5-year OS rate was 91.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 89.1%–94.5%) with ALND and 92.5% (95% CI, 90.0%–95.1%) with SLN biopsy alone.Detailed analysis of the radiation field design found that 15% of patients also received treatment to the supraclavicular region (in addition to standard tangents).
