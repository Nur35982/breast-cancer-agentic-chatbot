There are three stage group tables for invasive cancer:[3] Anatomical Stage Group.The Anatomical Stage Group table is used in regions of the world where tumor grading and/or biomarker testing for ER, PR, and HER2 are not routinely available.
(SeeTable 8.) Clinical Prognostic Stage Group.The Clinical Prognostic Stage Group table is used for all patients in the United States.
Patients who have neoadjuvant therapy as their initial treatment should have the clinical prognostic stage and the observed degree of response to treatment recorded, but these patients are not assigned a pathological prognostic stage.
