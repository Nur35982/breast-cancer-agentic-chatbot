This section outlines factors to consider when making this decision.
Information about the treatment of locally advanced or inflammatory breast cancer is also included in this section.
Preoperative chemotherapy, also known as primary or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, has traditionally been given to patients with locally advanced breast cancer to reduce tumor volume and allow for definitive surgery.
Treatment with preoperative chemotherapy can also allow for breast conservation therapy in patients who are not candidates for breast conservation at initial presentation.
Preoperative chemotherapy may also reduce the need for an axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) in patients presenting with node-positive disease.
