Grade 1 to 2 nausea, infection, fatigue, and diarrhea were also noted.
Grade 3 to 4 hepatobiliary toxic effects occurred in 14.4% of patients who received ribociclib and 4.8% of patients who received placebo.
Prolonged QTcF interval occurred in 4.5% of patients in the ribociclib group and 2.1% of patients in the placebo group.
The primary end point (investigator-assessed PFS) was met.
A preplanned interim analysis was performed after 243 patients had disease progression or died, and median duration of follow-up was 15.3 months.
After 18 months, the PFS rate was 63.0% (95% CI, 54.6%–70.3%) in the ribociclib group and 42.2% (95% CI, 34.8%–49.5%) in the placebo group.[12] OS was a secondary end point.
