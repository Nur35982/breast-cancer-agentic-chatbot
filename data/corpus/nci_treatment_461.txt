One patient in the sacituzumab govitecan group died of a treatment-related adverse event (septic shock related to neutropenic colitis).The objective response rate by blinded independent central review was 21% in the sacituzumab govitecan group and 14% in the chemotherapy group.
The clinical benefit rate was higher with sacituzumab govitecan than with chemotherapy (34% vs.
22%).
An analysis noted a 34% reduction in the risk of progression or death (HR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53â€“0.83;P= .0003).
The median PFS was 5.5 months in the sacituzumab govitecan group and 4.0 months in the chemotherapy group.
The PFS at 6 and 12 months was 46% and 21% for patients who received sacituzumab govitecan and 30% and 7% for patients who received chemotherapy.
