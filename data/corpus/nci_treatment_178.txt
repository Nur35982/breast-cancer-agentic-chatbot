Although the toxicity profile of preoperative hormonal therapy over the course of 3 to 6 months is favorable, the pCR rates obtained (1%â€“8%) are far lower than have been reported with chemotherapy in unselected populations.[18][Level of evidence B3] Longer duration of preoperative therapy may be required in this patient population.
Preoperative tamoxifen was associated with an overall response rate of 33%, with maximum response occurring up to 12 months after therapy in some patients.[19] A randomized study of 4, 8, or 12 months of preoperative letrozole in older patients who were not fit for chemotherapy indicated that the longer duration of therapy resulted in the highest pCR rate (17.5% vs.
