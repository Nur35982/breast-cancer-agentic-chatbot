Five-year absolute survival differences were 5% for DFS and 3% for OS, in favor of taxane-containing regimens.[22][Level of evidence A1] A number of studies have addressed the optimal chemotherapy schedule and taxane selection.
An Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group–led intergroup trial (E1199[NCT00004125]) involving 4,950 patients compared, in a factorial design, two schedules (weekly and every 3 weeks) of the two drugs (docetaxel vs.
paclitaxel) after standard-dose AC chemotherapy given every 3 weeks.[27][Level of evidence A1] Study findings include the following: There was no difference observed in the overall comparison of docetaxel to paclitaxel with regard to DFS (odds ratio [OR], 1.03; 95% CI, 0.91–1.16;P= .61) or between the 1-week and 3-week schedules (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.94–1.20;P= .33).
