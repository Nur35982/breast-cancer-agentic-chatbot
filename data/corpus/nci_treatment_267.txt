53.2%;P= .005) in patients with TNBC.Patients withBRCA1orBRCA2variants had a higher rate of pCR, which was not increased by the addition of carboplatin (66.7% in the nonplatinum arm vs.
65.7% in the platinum-containing arm).The 3-year DFS rate was higher for patients with TNBC randomly assigned to the carboplatin arm (86.1% vs.
75.8%; HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.34−0.93), but OS did not differ.[104]The more intensive regimen was also associated with increased toxicity and treatment discontinuations (39% vs.
48%).
Higher pCR rates were observed with the addition of carboplatin to an anthracycline/taxane–based backbone compared with anthracycline/taxane alone (36.9% vs.
