The 10-year distant recurrence risk for patients treated with tamoxifen was 7% for those with a low recurrence score (defined in this trial as <18), 14% for those with an intermediate recurrence score (defined in this trial as 18–30), and 31% for those with high recurrence score (defined in this trial as ≥31) (P< .001).[73]A community-based, case-control study examined the prognostic ability of the recurrence score to predict breast cancer deaths after 10 years in a group of tamoxifen-treated patients and observed a similar prognostic pattern to that seen in patients from NSABP B-14.[74] The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP B-14) trial randomly assigned patients to receive tamoxifen or placebo; the results favoring tamoxifen changed clinical practice in the late 1980s.[72] Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue was available for 668 patients.
