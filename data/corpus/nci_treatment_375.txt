In theNCCTG-N9831trial, 39 cardiac events were reported in the three arms over a 3-year period.
The 3-year cumulative incidence of cardiac events was 0.35% in arm A (no trastuzumab), 3.5% in arm B (trastuzumab after paclitaxel), and 2.5% in arm C, (trastuzumab concomitant with paclitaxel).
In theAVENTIS-TAX-GMA-302(BCIRG 006) trial (NCT00021255), clinically symptomatic cardiac events were detected in 0.38% of patients in the doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide (AC)/docetaxel (AC-D) arm, 1.87% of patients in the AC/docetaxel/trastuzumab (AC-DH) arm, and 0.37% of patients in the docetaxel/carboplatin/trastuzumab (DCbH) arm.[12] There was also a statistically significant higher incidence of asymptomatic and persistent decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in the AC-DH arm than with either the AC-D or DCbH arms.
