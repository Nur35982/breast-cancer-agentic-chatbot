96% CI for the tamoxifen-alone arm;P= .16).[67][Level of evidence B1] There was a significant difference in EFS (HR, 0.80; 95% CI;P= .0009), but not in OS (5-year OS, 97% CI for the switched arm vs.
96% CI for the tamoxifen-alone arm;P= .16).[67][Level of evidence B1] A large, double-blind, randomized trial (EORTC-10967[ICCG-96OEXE031-C1396-BIG9702]) (NCT00003418) of 4,742 patients compared continuing tamoxifen with switching to exemestane for a total of 5 years of therapy in women who had received 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen.[68][Level of evidence B1]After the second planned interim analysis, when median follow-up for patients on the study was 30.6 months, the results were released because of a highly significant (P< .005) difference in DFS (HR, 0.68) favoring the exemestane arm.[68]After a median follow-up of 55.7 months, the HR for DFS was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66–0.88;P= .001) in favor of exemestane.[69][Level of evidence A1]At 2.5 years after random assignment, 3.3% fewer patients on exemestane had developed a DFS event (95% CI, 1.6–4.9).
