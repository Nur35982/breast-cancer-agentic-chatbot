0%).
OS differences were not significant after further follow-up.[28] TAMRAD(NCT01298713) was an open-label, randomized, phase II trial comparing tamoxifen with tamoxifen plus everolimus in postmenopausal women whose disease had progressed after receiving an AI in the adjuvant or metastatic setting.
The trial randomly assigned 57 women to receive tamoxifen and 54 women to receive the combination therapy.[29]Median time to progression was 8.6 months in the combination group and 4.5 months in the tamoxifen group (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.56−0.81;P= .002).Toxicities were greater on the everolimus arm and similar to those in the BOLERO2 trial.In an exploratory analysis, OS was 32.9 months in the tamoxifen group and not reached in the combination group (HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.24−0.81;P= .007).[29][Level of evidence A1] Median time to progression was 8.6 months in the combination group and 4.5 months in the tamoxifen group (HR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.56−0.81;P= .002).
