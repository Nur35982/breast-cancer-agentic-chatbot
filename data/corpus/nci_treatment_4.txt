Obesity (postmenopausal).[16] Personal history of breast cancer.[17] Personal history of benign proliferative breast disease.[18-20] Radiation exposure to breast/chest.[21] Age-specific risk estimates are available to help design screening strategies for women with and without a family history of breast cancer.
The most commonly used tools include theGail modeland theIBIS/Tyrer-Cuzick model, version 8(which incorporates family history to a greater extent than the Gail model, as well as breast density).[22] Of all women with breast cancer, 5% to 10% may have a germline pathogenic variant in theBRCA1andBRCA2genes.[23] SpecificBRCA1andBRCA2variants are more common in women of Jewish ancestry.[24] In women withBRCA1andBRCA2pathogenic variants, the estimated lifetime risk of developing breast cancer is 40% to 85%.BRCA1andBRCA2carriers with a history of breast cancer have increased risk of contralateral disease that may be as high as 5% per year.[25] Men withBRCA1andBRCA2pathogenic variants also have increased breast cancer risk.[26] BRCA1andBRCA2pathogenic variants also increase risk of ovarian cancer [26,27] and other primary cancers.[26,27] Once aBRCA1orBRCA2variant has been identified, other family members can be referred for genetic counseling and testing.[28-31] For more information, seeGenetics of Breast and Gynecologic Cancers,Breast Cancer Prevention, andBreast Cancer Screening.
