80.7%,P= .06).
Distant DFS was improved among patients who underwent regional nodal irradiation when compared with patients who did not undergo regional nodal irradiation (78% vs.
75%,P= .02).[19][Level of evidence A1] A meta-analysis of individual patient data from all randomized trials of regional lymph node radiation therapy versus no regional lymph node radiation therapy in women with early breast cancer included 16 clinical trials involving 14,324 participants.
It found that radiation therapy significantly reduced breast cancer mortality (RR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80–0.94;P= .0010), with no significant effect on non–breast cancer mortality (RR, 0.97; 0.84–1.11;P= .63), leading to significantly reduced all-cause mortality (RR, 0.90; 0.84–0.96;P= .0022).
