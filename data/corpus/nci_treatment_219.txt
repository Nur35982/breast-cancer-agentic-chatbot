tamoxifen as initial therapy in postmenopausal women): A large randomized trial of 9,366 patients compared the use of the AI anastrozole and the combination of anastrozole and tamoxifen with tamoxifen alone as adjuvant therapy for postmenopausal patients with lymph node–negative or lymph node–positive disease.
Most (84%) of the patients in the study were hormone receptor–positive.
Slightly more than 20% had received chemotherapy.[61]; [62][Level of evidence B1]With a median follow-up of 33.3 months, no benefit in DFS was observed for the combination arm relative to tamoxifen alone.[61]Patients on anastrozole, however, had a significantly longer DFS (HR, 0.83) than those on tamoxifen.
