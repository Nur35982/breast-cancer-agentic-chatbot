Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has supported use of pCR as an end point in preoperative clinical trials for patients with high-risk, early-stage breast cancer.
Unfortunately, categorizing patients as having pCR or residual disease offers no distinction among patients with varied amounts of residual disease.
The residual cancer burden (RCB) method was designed to address this and other prognostic deficits.
The RCB method provides a standard to evaluate and quantify the extent of residual disease in breast and axillary lymph nodes following neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
It is reported as a continuous score, with pCR being scored as RCB-0.
