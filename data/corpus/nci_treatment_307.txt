In this trial, 232 women younger than 67 years with node-positive or high-risk (>2 cm tumor size) node-negative HER2-overexpressing breast cancer were given nine weekly infusions of trastuzumab concurrently with docetaxel or vinorelbine followed by FEC.[134][Level of evidence A1]At a 3-year median follow-up, the risk of recurrence and/or death was significantly reduced in patients receiving trastuzumab (3-year DFS rate, 89% vs.
