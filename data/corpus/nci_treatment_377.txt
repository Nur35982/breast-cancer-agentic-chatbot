Asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction was observed in 6.9% of patients receiving pertuzumab alone (n = 331; 95% CI, 4.5%–10.2%), 3.4% of patients receiving pertuzumab in combination with a non–anthracycline-containing chemotherapy (n = 175; 95% CI, 1.3%–7.3%), and 6.5% of patients receiving pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab (n = 93; 95% CI, 2.4%–13.5%).
Symptomatic heart failure was observed in one patient (0.3%) who received pertuzumab alone, two patients (1.1%) who received pertuzumab in combination with a non–anthracycline-containing chemotherapy, and one patient (1.1%) who received pertuzumab in combination with trastuzumab.
