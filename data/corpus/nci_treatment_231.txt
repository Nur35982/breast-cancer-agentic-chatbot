The evidence, as described below, indicates that switching to an AI after 5 years of tamoxifen is superior to stopping tamoxifen at that time.
A large, double-blinded, randomized trial (CAN-NCIC-MA17[NCT00003140]) of 5,187 patients compared the use of letrozole versus placebo in receptor-positive postmenopausal women who received tamoxifen for approximately 5 years (range, 4.5–6.0) years.[76][Level of evidence B1]After the first planned interim analysis, when median follow-up for patients in the study was 2.4 years, the results were unblinded because of a highly significant (P< .008) difference in DFS (HR, 0.57), favoring the letrozole arm.[76]After 3 years of follow-up, 4.8% of the women on the letrozole arm had developed recurrent disease or new primaries versus 9.8% on the placebo arm (95% CI for the difference, 2.7%–7.3%).
