After the first planned interim analysis, when median follow-up for patients in the study was 2.4 years, the results were unblinded because of a highly significant (P< .008) difference in DFS (HR, 0.57), favoring the letrozole arm.[76] After 3 years of follow-up, 4.8% of the women on the letrozole arm had developed recurrent disease or new primaries versus 9.8% on the placebo arm (95% CI for the difference, 2.7%–7.3%).
Because of the early unblinding of the study, longer-term comparative data on the risks and benefits of letrozole in this setting will not be available.[77,78] An updated analysis including all events before unblinding confirmed the results of the interim analysis.[79] In addition, a statistically significant improvement in distant DFS was found for patients who received letrozole (HR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.43–0.84;P= .002).
