Grade 3 to 4 hepatobiliary toxic effects occurred in 14.4% of patients who received ribociclib and 4.8% of patients who received placebo.
Prolonged QTcF interval occurred in 4.5% of patients in the ribociclib group and 2.1% of patients in the placebo group.
Ribociclib has also been tested in combination with fulvestrant in postmenopausal patients with HER2-negative hormone receptorâ€“positive, recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.
TheMONALEESA-3trial (NCT02422615) included patients receiving first-line or second-line therapy.
This phase III, placebo-controlled trial randomly assigned 726 patients in a 2:1 ratio to receive ribociclib plus fulvestrant or placebo plus fulvestrant.[15]The primary end point (investigator-assessed PFS) was met.
